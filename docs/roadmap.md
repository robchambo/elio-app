# Elio Roadmap

**Last updated:** 29 May 2026 (Added row 18 — guest pantry parity + builder tap-cycle UI; part-b encoding = tier fill-style (outline/solid/green), not freshness. Sprint 17 status reconciled against current `main` + open PRs + deployed-infra state ahead of Sprint 17 launch-prep work.)

**Active branch:** `main` @ `dc1131c`. Sprint 16 + 16.8 squash-merged. Latest APK: `releases/elio-sprint-26may-b.apk`, tag `build/sprint-26may-b`.
**Open PRs vs `main`:** #13 `fix/pantry-dedup-and-builder-failures` (pantry write + Builder error surfacing) · #14 `fix/guest-regen-paywall-and-error-toasts` (recipe-screen regen gate + friendly toasts) · #7 `claude/ios-dev-setup-prompt-MNul1` (iOS docs). Test rows on the Test Hub.
**Sprint 17 launch-prep:** cut `sprint/17-integration` fresh off `main` whenever ready — no Sprint 16 wait remaining. `origin/sprint-17` stale (rules + entitlement content already on `main` via parallel commits, except `proOverride` client-code removal — tracked as Sprint 17 #14).
**Deployed Cloud Functions (`elio-prototype`):** `generateImportAddress`, `postmarkInbound` (us-central1) · `crashlyticsFatal` / `Nonfatal` / `Velocity` / `Regression` → Notion Crashes DB (us-east1). All nodejs22.

**Recent (1–15 May 2026):**
- Sprint 15.9.2 — Gemini warmup (cold-start reliability)
- Dietary/allergen safety audit (8+ commits on `sprint/16`) — major pre-launch risk closed
- Sprint 16.1 — Settings Redesign (4-section tree, unified dietary plumbing)
- Sprint 16.1.x — Auth UX fix (Sign In tile, Restart Onboarding, sign-out preserves onboardingComplete)
- **Streaming model swap (15 May 2026)** — recipe-generation hot path moved `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` after a head-to-head eval (`tool/eval/run.dart` × 5 fixtures on `claude/compare-gemini-models-9in2t`). Flash-Lite matched Flash on TTFT, beat it on total stream time (~1 s faster), cost (~83% cheaper), and structural pass rate. Prewarm call also swapped to match. Subjectively "noticeably quicker" on-device with no quality regression. Branch `fix/flash-lite-streaming`, commit `c58c924`, APK tag `build/sprint-16-integration-flash-lite`.

**Sprint 16.4 polish (April 2026):**
- Bug 4 — Pantry single-tap removed (long-press only); Remove lives in the long-press picker.
- Bug 5 — Home Recent Recipes pushed below the fold via LayoutBuilder.
- Bug 6 — Recipes-tab filters (search, makeable-now, category chips) removed; TODO flag for revisit.
- Bug 3 — Per-tier "+ Add" chip on Pantry tab; perishables get a freshness-bucket follow-up.
- Bug 1 — EntitlementService.refresh() kicked off on Home initState so Plan-your-week appears on cold start.
- Bug 2 — Top-3 most-urgent perishables auto-selected in PerishablesPickerScreen (default; overridable).
- Bonus — Recipes-tab "Take photo" / "Manual entry" bento cards now wire to the live RecipeImportScreen with the right initial tab (photo import was already built, just unwired).

## Launch Strategy

**Goal:** Launch Android and iOS together. Android builds first and may reach production a few days earlier, but both platforms are worked toward a coordinated public release. No dedicated "Android-only" launch — iOS parity is part of the launch deliverable.

Work is grouped into three parallel tracks:
1. **Shared platform work** (security, legal, assets, regression) — blocks both stores.
2. **Android track** — Play Console, internal testing, staged rollout.
3. **iOS track** — Xcode config, Apple Sign-In, Siri Shortcuts, TestFlight, App Store review.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Google Sign-In SHA-1 fix for new devices | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Paywall appearing unexpectedly — audit trigger logic | 1–2 | ✅ Done (audited — all 4 triggers properly gated, no issue found) |
| 3 | Notification service — wire `requestPermissionAndRegister()` to a trigger | 1 | ✅ Done (`init()` at startup, permission request on first HomeScreen load) |
| 4 | Paywall integration tests — update stale assertions from trial-first rewrite | 1 | ✅ Done (headlines updated to match context-based copy) |
| 5 | RevenueCat API key — wire through `build.ps1` / `.env.local` | 1 | ✅ Done (optional — warns in dry mode, passes via `--dart-define`) |
| 6 | `ErrorService` coverage — add to GeminiService, FirestoreService, VoiceControlService, PurchaseService | 1–2 | ✅ Done (~15 new call sites across 6 services) |

---

## Sprint 15.6 — Side Dishes, Shopping UX & Bug Fixes ✅

**Goal:** New side dish feature, shopping list UX improvements, and bug fixes from on-device testing.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|

| 2 | Meal plan shopping — confirmation dialog with editable items, select/deselect, "View shopping list" link | 2 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Recipe screen shopping — same confirmation dialog for individual recipe add-to-shopping | 1.5 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Purge residual staples (water/salt) from Firestore shopping items | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Meal plan timeout fix — HTTP timeouts (90s/60s/45s), token budget 4096→6144, staggered progress messages | 1.5 | ✅ Done |

**Build:** `elio-sprint-15.6.apk` (72.9 MB)

---

## Sprint 15.7 — Shopping Share & Unit Abbreviations ✅

**Goal:** Share shopping list, abbreviate ingredient units, fix pantry builder tier picker.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Shopping list share button — formats unchecked items by aisle, shares via system share sheet | 1 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Unit abbreviations — `QuantityUtils.normalizeUnit()` maps "grams"→"g", "millilitres"→"ml" etc. across all recipe screen display locations | 1 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Pantry Builder tier picker — changed `showModalBottomSheet` → `showDialog` (nested sheet was failing silently) | 0.5 | ✅ Done |

**Build:** `elio-sprint-15.7.apk` (72.9 MB)

---

## Sprint 15.8 — Bug Fixes & UX Polish ✅

**Goal:** Fix remaining bugs found during on-device testing.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Pantry Builder long-press — removed guard that blocked tier change for items already in pantry | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Bookmark toggle on imported recipes — `_savedAt` now captured on auto-save so toggle works | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Back button touch targets — added 8px padding to all 7 bare `GestureDetector` back buttons across screens | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Household member delete — 350ms delay after sheet dismiss before opening confirmation dialog (animation race condition) | 0.5 | ✅ Done |

**Build:** `elio-sprint-15.8.apk` (72.9 MB)

---

## Sprint 15.9 — Personalised Pantry Builder ✅ (April 2026)

**Goal:** Memory-driven pantry builder — surface what users have actually had via tierMemory, custom items, and inventory backfill. Universal staples (salt, pepper, water, sugar, generic oils) excluded; dietary conflicts greyed.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract PantryStaples utility from ShoppingService | ✅ |
| 2 | PantryMemoryEntry model | ✅ |
| 3 | PantryMemoryService — read paths (recentUsuals, hadBeforeKeys, customsByCategory) | ✅ |
| 4 | PantryMemoryService — write paths (upsertCustom, backfillFromInventoryIfNeeded) | ✅ |
| 5 | showAddPantryItemDialog blocks staples with inline note | ✅ |
| 6 | Builder sheet — "Your usuals" section + tier-defaulting | ✅ |
| 7 | Builder sheet — had-before dots + customs-first chips + dietary greying | ✅ |
| 8 | Pantry-screen wiring of upsertCustom | ✅ |
| 9 | Docs (CLAUDE.md + roadmap.md) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/15.9-personalized-pantry`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-sprint-15.9-personalized-pantry-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-30-sprint-15.9-personalized-pantry.md`.

---

## Sprint 15.9.1 — Inventory Dedup ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Stop `FirestoreService.addInventoryItem` creating duplicate Firestore docs when a user re-imports an item via any path. Existing rows update; tier sticks (existing wins); perishable expiry refreshes; `lastPurchasedAt` always refreshes.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract PantryStringMatch utility from ShoppingService._singularise | ✅ |
| 2 | InventoryWriter skeleton + storage interface + fake | ✅ |
| 3 | InventoryWriter.addItem with dedup + tier-sticky rule book | ✅ |
| 4 | Lazy migration of legacy rows on first addItem | ✅ |
| 5 | FirestoreService.addInventoryItem delegates to InventoryWriter | ✅ |
| 6 | Docs (CLAUDE.md schema + roadmap.md) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/15.9.1-inventory-dedup`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-sprint-15.9.1-inventory-dedup-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-01-sprint-15.9.1-inventory-dedup.md`.

---

## Sprint 16 — UI Overhaul — COMPLETE (April 2026, pending minor bug tweaks)

All 4 ready-for-dev screens (Home, Pantry, Recipe, Dietary) plus stretch screens (Shopping, Recipe Book, Account, Recipe Preferences, Paywall, Meal Plan, Hands-Free, Onboarding) shipped with the new Elio design system. 17 widgets in `lib/widgets/elio/`, 3 new token files in `lib/theme/`, 25/25 tests passing.

**Not tagged yet** — Rob has minor bug tweaks outstanding. Tag `v0.16.0-ui-overhaul` after those + on-device verification.

### Sprint 16b — Onboarding rebuild (branch: `sprint/16-onboarding-rebuild`, pushed 20 Apr)

15-screen, sell-to-self, sign-in-deferred onboarding. Replaces the legacy 8-screen sign-in-first flow. All pre-auth state lives in `OnboardingController` (ChangeNotifier) + `GuestPantryService` (SharedPreferences); `MigrationService` handles guest→Firestore on screen 15 sign-in.

**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-onboarding-rebuild.md` (7 phases, ~31 tasks)
**Specs:** `docs/onboarding/00-overview.md` + `01-welcome.md` → `15-account.md`
**Progress:** 42 commits, 239 tests passing, `flutter analyze` clean. APK `releases/elio-sprint-16.1-onboarding.apk` (71.7 MB).

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | State delta + controller + guest-pantry + AuthGate inversion + 11 widgets + palette tokens | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Screens 01 welcome, 02 goal, 03 household, 04 dietary (w/ Option B household union) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Screen 05 allergies & dislikes | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Screens 06 time, 07 confidence, 08 appliances, 09 region & units | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Screens 10 pantry intro, 11 staples, 12 perishables | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Screen 13 first-recipe demo + Gemini ephemeral entry point | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Paywall (14, goal-keyed headlines) + Account (15, sign-in deferred) + MigrationService full impl + PurchaseService.aliasToUid | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Coordinator `onboarding_flow.dart` + analytics wiring + APK build | ✅ Done |

**In flight: Sprint 16.2 — Copy polish pass** (stays on `sprint/16-onboarding-rebuild`, not a separate sprint). Screen-by-screen walkthrough of copy on 01 → 15: spec `.md` + screen `.dart` kept in lockstep, commit per screen. Flag conditional variants (screens 05/07/10/13/14).

**Progress (22 Apr → 18 May):** Screens 03 (household), 04 (dietary), 05 (allergies), 06 (time), 07 (confidence), 08 (appliances, 3-col grid + tighter tiles), 09 (region — post-override helper dropped) all polished + committed. Screen 10 reviewed, illustration flagged for Kate. Screens 11/12 got the v1 "+ Add something" per-category tile with dedup (exact-match silent promote / fuzzy-match confirm via `PantryUtils.findDuplicates`) — shipped `feat(sprint-16-onboarding): + Add something tile on screens 11/12 with dedup`. Screens 13 (first-recipe demo), 14 (paywall), 15 (account) walked + committed — copy verified against spec on 18 May; specs have explicit `Sprint 16.2 notes / Sprint 16.2 update` sections recording the polish decisions that shipped (per-goal headlines, region-aware takeaway variant, feature comparison addition, tappable Terms + Privacy footer, "coming soon" toasts for Apple + Email).

**Then:** on-device smoke test → tag `v16.1-onboarding-rebuild` → merge to `sprint/16`.

**Open items (non-blocking):**
- Screen 11 default count: 20 vs spec "~16" prose.
- Palette tokens `freshGreen`/`perishToday`/`perishThisWeek` placeholder hex — Kate to ratify.
- Screen 10 hero illustration placeholder (🧊) — Kate art.
- Screen 11/12 search bar not built (flagged later after on-device feedback).
- Screen 11/12 full dietary/allergy filtering beyond default-exclude — deferred: needs per-item metadata pass on ~100+ `PantryCategories` items (content authoring, Kate-voice decision on hide vs grey).
- Coordinator uses per-screen progress bars rather than a single coordinator-owned bar (minor visual refactor).
- ~~**Bulk Prep on the recipe prefs screen — Kate design pass.**~~ Dropped 2026-05-17 (Rob). Current prefs screen has Saver + Leftover only; the dedicated `BulkPrepResultsScreen` flow (Pro) is the way in for now. Revisit only if user feedback specifically asks for a Bulk-Prep entry from prefs.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Design system finalised — colours, typography, spacing, component specs | 2–3 | Done |
| 2 | Home screen — visual refresh | 2–3 | Done |
| 3 | Recipe screen — visual refresh | 1–2 | Done |
| 4 | Profile / pantry / recipe book — visual refresh | 2–3 | Done |
| 5 | Onboarding — visual refresh | 1–2 | Done |
| 6 | Paywall — visual refresh | 1 | Done |
| 7 | Cross-app consistency pass + cleanup | 1–2 | Done |

---

## Sprint 15.9.2 — Gemini Cold-Start Warmup ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Address the known "Gemini first-attempt fails after app launch" reliability issue. Pre-warm the Flash connection at app launch + on Home so the first user-facing recipe generation doesn't pay the cold-start tax.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `GeminiService.prewarmConnection()` — fire-and-forget at app launch | ✅ |
| 2 | Home initState pre-warms on top of app-launch warmup (idempotent) | ✅ |
| 3 | Onboarding screen 12 calls warmup defensively before screen 13 transition | ✅ |
| 4 | Fix `MAX_TOKENS` no longer breaking recipe generation (related, batched together) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/15.9.2-gemini-warmup` (pushed). Covers every entry path — onboarding screen 13, returning-user Home Generate, post-background warm-starts.

---

## Sprint 16 — Dietary/Allergen Safety Audit ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Close the highest-priority pre-launch risk — silent allergen/dietary failures. Pre-fix: peanuts could land in recipes for nut-allergic users, dietary constraints could be silently dropped, auto-save failures could surface as ghost settings, and AuthGate's Firestore fallback didn't cover the no-network case. Eight commits on `sprint/16` after the 16.4 polish that hardened the food-safety stack end-to-end.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Allergens silently dropped — root cause + hard fix in prompt assembly | ✅ |
| 2 | Auto-save was silently failing — three failure modes closed (verify-after-save, force-refresh, canonicalisation) | ✅ |
| 3 | Post-gen allergen filter + craving-override prompt | ✅ |
| 4 | Allergen filter singular/plural — "peanuts" and "peanut" both match | ✅ |
| 5 | AuthGate Firestore fallback for the no-local-flag case | ✅ |
| 6 | Allergen exclusion hoisted to a position-1 safety preamble in the Gemini prompt | ✅ |
| 7 | Time preference now drives recipe ambition | ✅ |
| 8 | Prompt audit fixes — appliances, mood, runningLow, default creative, dedup | ✅ |
| 9 | Verify-after-save read-back surfaces silent server denial | ✅ |
| 10 | Stamp request constraints onto `recipe.dietaryTags` (pill honesty) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/16` (pushed). Testing protocol: `docs/strategy/2026-05-06-allergen-testing-procedure.html` + `docs/strategy/2026-05-07-weekend-test-protocol.html`. Weekend on-device verification scheduled.

**Why this matters:** Competitor analysis (`docs/strategy/2026-05-03-competitor-analysis.html`) flagged DishGen's hallucination failure mode — "peanuts in recipes for allergic users" — as Elio's existential risk. This audit closes it before launch.

---

## Sprint 16.1 — Settings Redesign ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Replace the legacy single-list "Account" screen with a four-section iOS-style Settings tree (Household / Preferences / Account / About). Unify dietary plumbing as a single source of truth with reactive sync so changes propagate from Settings → generation without manual refresh.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | 4-section Settings tree (Household / Preferences / Account / About) | ✅ |
| 2 | Inline segmented controls for Measurement Units + Region (no sub-screen) | ✅ |
| 3 | Inline switch for Saver Mode default (writes to user doc) | ✅ |
| 4 | Account section: Manage Subscription + Restore Purchases + Sign Out + Delete Account | ✅ |
| 5 | About section: Privacy Policy + Terms of Service (in-app `LegalDocScreen`) + Export My Data + Send Feedback + App Version | ✅ |
| 6 | Drop the "Food Style" tile (per Rob's review of the spec) | ✅ |
| 7 | GDPR services (`AccountService.deleteAccount`, `DataExportService.exportData`) wired | ✅ |
| 8 | Send Feedback dialog with support email + tap-to-copy | ✅ |
| 9 | Unified dietary plumbing — single source of truth + reactive sync from Settings → generation | ✅ |
| 10 | Canonicalise lowercase onboarding tokens on read (drift between onboarding capture and Settings) | ✅ |
| 11 | Shopping list snackbar lifecycle (dismiss on time + on View tap) | ✅ |
| 12 | Appliances case-mismatch fix in Settings → Kitchen Appliances flow | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/16.1-settings-redesign` (pushed through `55a144f`). Spec: `docs/strategy/Elio settings.docx`. File: `lib/screens/account/account_screen.dart` (rendered title is "settings.", file name kept for AppShell top-bar routing stability).

**Pending:** on-device weekend test pass per `docs/strategy/2026-05-07-weekend-test-protocol.html` → tag → merge to `sprint/16`.

---

## Sprint 16.1.x — Auth UX Fix ✅ (11 May 2026)

**Goal:** Fix the three-way trap blocking signed-out testing and confusing real users: (a) no Sign In path outside the 15-screen onboarding flow, (b) Sign Out wiped `onboardingComplete` forcing re-onboarding, (c) no deliberate "I want to walk onboarding again" action distinct from Sign Out.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract `performSignOut` + `performRestartOnboarding` to `lib/screens/account/account_actions.dart` — pure top-level helpers with injected callbacks for unit testability | ✅ |
| 2 | `performSignOut` no longer wipes `onboardingComplete` — user lands on AppShell as guest after sign-out | ✅ |
| 3 | AccountScreen Account section: conditional "Sign In" tile (guest only, pushes `EmailLoginScreen`); Sign Out + Delete hidden for guests | ✅ |
| 4 | AccountScreen About section: new "Restart Onboarding" action with confirm dialog — wipes guest pantry + flag, routes via AuthGate | ✅ |
| 5 | 7 unit tests in `test/screens/account/account_actions_test.dart`; full suite 448/448 passing, `flutter analyze` clean | ✅ |

**Commit:** `8fbc553` on `sprint/16.1-settings-redesign` (local only). **Not pushed** until on-device verification passes.

**Verification flow:** open the build → land on AppShell as guest → profile icon → AccountScreen → tap "Sign In" → email login → returns to AppShell signed-in. Then: AccountScreen → Sign Out → still on AppShell, still post-onboarding (no 15-screen replay). Then: AccountScreen → About → Restart Onboarding → walks the flow from screen 1.

## Competitor Analysis Cross-Reference (3 May 2026)

Source doc: `docs/strategy/2026-05-03-competitor-analysis.html` — deep-scan of 9 apps (Paprika · Mealime · SideChef · DishGen · Samsung Food · AnyList · Bring! · OurGroceries · Plan to Eat, plus Yummly postmortem after Whirlpool's December 2024 shutdown).

### Three moats Elio already owns — protect, don't erode

1. **AI generation grounded in actual pantry + perishable urgency.** Nobody else combines these. DishGen takes ingredient lists; Samsung Food has Vision AI but no expiry/dietary integration; Mealime + Paprika + AnyList don't generate at all.
2. **Receipt OCR + barcode + expiry-driven generation.** Samsung Food has barcode + Vision AI for ordering; no competitor does receipt OCR feeding recipe selection.
3. **Household dietary union math.** No competitor combines multiple humans' dietary restrictions and allergens into a single weekly plan.

### Five must-match gaps from analysis → sprint mapping

| # | Gap | Where it lives in this roadmap |
|---|-----|---------------------------|
| 1 | Real household sharing with email/link invite | **Sprint 16.7a investigation → 16.7b implementation** |
| 2 | In-app cooking timers + cook mode | **Sprint 16.6** |
| 3 | Browseable saved-recipe library + collections | **Sprint 16.7c** |
| 4 | Apple Watch + voice-assistant add-to-list | **Split:** Siri Shortcuts already in Sprint 19 (iOS pre-launch); Apple Watch + Alexa post-launch. Google Assistant blocked — Conversational Actions sunset June 2023, no viable Android voice path. |
| 5 | User-customisable aisle ordering | **Sprint 16.7c** |

### Deliberate omissions — features competitors have that Elio should NOT build

Capture here so they don't keep resurfacing in planning.

| Don't build | Why |
|---|---|
| Public recipe library / community feed | Yummly tried (now dead); DishGen does it badly (stolen recipes from Minimalist Baker). Moderation cost huge; dilutes the AI-from-your-pantry value. |
| Smart-fridge integration | Samsung Food's moat. Irrelevant for US-priority launch. |
| 18,000-recipe browseable corpus | SideChef's moat. Elio is generation-first; a library distracts from the differentiation. Personal saved-recipe library (Sprint 16.7c) is enough. |
| One-time pricing per platform (Paprika model) | Firestore + Gemini API recurring costs make it unsustainable for an AI app. |
| Step photos / videos for AI-generated recipes | Generated recipes can't have authentic cooking photos. Stock or AI-generated images would erode trust. Voice cooking is the "active cooking" answer. |
| Calorie/macro tracking with daily targets | MyFitnessPal territory. Different audience, harder to win. Per-recipe nutrition only. |
| Coupons / store flyers / price tracking | Flipp / Ibotta territory. Mood-killer for "what should I cook tonight." |

## Sprint 16.5 — Settings Menu On-Device Polish (Queued)

**Goal:** Walk every row of the new 4-section Settings tree on-device, catch the small things widget tests won't, ship the polish pass.

**Trigger:** Sprint 16.1 + 16.1.x both code-complete. Some items will be discovered during Rob's on-device run.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | On-device walk of every Settings row — copy, layout, tap targets, sub-screen pushes | Pending on-device pass |
| 2 | Manage Subscription — keep snackbar pointing to store, or deep-link to platform subscription page? | Not started |
| 3 | Notification Prefs sub-screen — confirm topics + toggles match what FCM actually subscribes to | Not started |
| 4 | Region toggle side-effects audit — US ↔ UK should propagate measurement units + currency across every screen | Not started |
| 5 | App Version row — show build tag (`build/sprint-X.Y`) alongside semver for easier QA reporting | Not started |
| 6 | Guest empty-state for AccountScreen — verify nothing flashes or errors when guest hits Settings (Firestore reads no-op for guests) | Not started |
| 7 | "Restart Onboarding" copy + dialog tone — confirm wording explains "Firestore data is kept, only local guest selections are cleared" clearly | Not started |
| 8 | New items discovered during the on-device walk | TBD |

**Estimate:** ~2 days once items crystallise on-device.

---

## Sprint 16.6 — Cook & Polish (Queued)

**Goal:** The "small but loud" pre-launch polish batch — cheap features competitors all have that reviewers complain about when missing.

| # | Task | Source | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Cooking timers + cook mode (screen-on)** on RecipeScreen. Paprika-style inline tappable times in method steps → `CookingTimerService` running timers; sticky timer bar across the recipe; `wakelock_plus` keeps the screen on while any timer is active; visible per-second tick + audible expiry beep. | Competitor analysis must-match gap #2 (Paprika + SideChef ship; reviews cite as stickiness driver) | ✅ Done (commits `26f7dcb` v1 → `57b6cbb` wakelock → `b7e1820` tick + audible) |
| 2 | ~~Dark mode~~ — explicitly dropped from Sprint 16.6 scope (12 May 2026, Rob). The cream / espresso / terracotta editorial palette is the brand; a dark variant would dilute it and the build cost is substantial relative to the launch-window value. Revisit only if 1-star reviews specifically cite the omission post-launch. | Competitor analysis flagged this as a must-match gap; product call says brand > parity | ❌ Dropped from scope |
| 3 | **Bulk-prep UI** — per-meal refresh ↺ icon on each `BulkPrepResultsScreen` card so a user can re-roll just one meal in the batch (mirrors the meal planner's per-slot regen). Wire-up to RecipeScreen + persistence shipped earlier (commits `299a013`, `9fd7b82`); this session added the refresh affordance via `GeminiService.generateBulkRecipeStream` with `previousMealTitles` set to all OTHER meals for meaningful dedup, Sprint 16.1 dietary refresh before regen, snackbar on error, keeps both old + new in history. | Existing TODO + competitor analysis | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) |
| 4 | **Perishable chip urgency-coloured backgrounds** on Pantry tab. `PantryChipUrgency.forItem` drives background + border + dot from expiry; matches the onboarding pantry-tile palette so Pantry tab and screens 11/12 speak the same colour language. | Standing follow-up (`project_perishable_chip_colors.md`) | ✅ Done (commit `4ba90a2`) |
| 5 | ~~Mood / style chip UI re-add on `RecipePreferencesScreen`~~ — confirmed stale (12 May 2026). The Time / Style / Mood chips have been live since Sprint 16's initial rebuild (`153e5a3`); Sprint 16.4 Bug 6 removed *Recipes-tab* filters, not prefs chips. Row was authored speculatively. | Sprint 16.4 deferred item | ❌ Closed as stale |
| 6 | Widget test asserting dietary filter actually greys a chip (plumbing tested, render path not). Added 2 render-path tests on `pantry_builder_sheet_usuals_test.dart`: vegan diet renders Milk chip with `TextDecoration.lineThrough` + dimmed mocha colour; empty dietary renders Milk with espresso + no decoration. Locks the conditional render branch in `_BuilderChip` so a future refactor that breaks the visual signal fails CI. | Sprint 15.9 pre-merge nit | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) — 2 new widget tests, 545/545 passing |
| 7 | `PantryMemoryEntry.isCustom` cleanup (drop or wire through) | Sprint 15.9 pre-merge nit | ✅ Done (commit `4ba90a2`) |
| 8 | **Pantry ↔ Shopping List "Restock" bridge** (Sprint 16.6.x). Pantry chip long-press exposes **Mark / Unmark running low** — sets `inventory.runningLow` AND adds/removes a `source: restock` shopping-list entry. Pantry chip shows a small terracotta **Low** badge; shopping row shows a **Restock** pill. Wires up `ShoppingService.addRestockItem` / `removeRestockItem`, which were defined but unreachable. | Test backlog item H4 unblocked — Rob asked "what is the restock button?" and the answer was "dead code" | ✅ Done (11 May 2026) — 6 new widget tests, 527/527 passing |
| 9 | **Small × on pantry chips for explicit delete.** Tiny × hit-target on every chip in the expanded tier rows. Tap → deletes immediately + shows "Removed X." snackbar with **Undo** (4-second window) that restores the chip via the same add path, preserving tier / expiry / runningLow. Distinct from long-press (tier / running-low / expiry picker — Remove still lives in-dialog for users already there). Implementation: `_TierItemChip` rebuilt as a side-by-side Row — RawGestureDetector for long-press on the chip body, separate GestureDetector + Tooltip + Semantics for the ×. Padding gives a ~30×26 hit area inside the existing chip footprint so chips don't grow tall. | Notion test list X-section, Rob 11 May | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) — 5 new widget tests, 532/532 passing |
| 10 | **Meal-type chip row on `RecipePreferencesScreen`.** New chip row above Time, below Bulk cook — three chips Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner, none selected by default. Single-select with mutual exclusivity (tapping Dinner deselects Breakfast) + tap-to-deselect (no "Any" sentinel — null is the no-preference state). Threads through `RecipePreferences.mealType` → `RecipeGenerationRequest.mealType` → a one-line hard constraint in `_buildPrompt` under `## HARD CONSTRAINTS`. **No example list deliberately** — positive examples ("eggs / toast / oatmeal") anchor output and narrow cultural breadth; Gemini-2.5-flash's training priors are stronger. Negative constraints can be added surgically later if device-test shows drift. | Rob 12 May 2026 | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) — 6 widget tests + 5 prompt unit tests, 543/543 passing |

**Estimate:** ~1 week.

## Sprint 16.7a — Household Sharing Investigation ✅ (11 May 2026)

**Goal:** Resolve the design complexity around real multi-user household sharing before committing to implementation. Output is a shovel-ready spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-sprint-16.7-household-sharing-design.md` plus a complexity estimate that gates Sprint 16.7b pre-/post-launch.

**Outcome:** Spec landed. Six foundational design decisions locked (full-share opt-in, owner-seeds-invitee-chooses migration, 6-digit code invites, owner's Pro extends to members, per-user dietary with cached household union, single-owner lifecycle). Independent `superpowers:code-reviewer` QA pass applied 5 critical fixes (dietary location, invitee-self-add rule, delete order, EntitlementService snippet, owner-profile filtering) and 5 worth-flagging adjustments. Final estimate: **~11 days** of focused implementation.

**Why this matters:** Competitor analysis must-match gap #1. AnyList's $14.99/yr household tier is the price anchor below Elio's $29.99/yr — defending requires real household sharing.

| # | Investigation question | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Firestore schema** — `households/{hid}` subtree with `owner`, `members[]`. Which sub-collections (shoppingItems, mealPlan, inventory, ratings, customItems, tierMemory) move from `users/{uid}/` to `households/{hid}/` vs stay per-UID? | Not started |
| 2 | **Invite flow** — Firebase Email Link / dynamic link / 6-digit code? Deep-link with accept-invite token. Edge cases: existing-account user vs new sign-up | Not started |
| 3 | **Security rules** — cross-UID read/write inside `households/{hid}/*` keyed on custom claims vs `get()` lookup. Performance trade-off | Not started |
| 4 | **Migration** — current household members are local profiles under one UID. Design for: (a) "head of household + dependents without phones" → keep profile-based; (b) "two adults each with own phone" → invite flow | Not started |
| 5 | **RevenueCat** — does household pricing need a new entitlement, or does an existing Pro subscriber's household grant Pro to invited members? Affects paywall copy | Not started |
| 6 | **Conflict resolution** — Firestore last-write-wins is fine; UI should attribute changes ("Kate added milk") | Not started |
| 7 | **UI scope** — invite tile on AccountScreen, member list in HouseholdScreen, owner-only actions, leave-household, guest-vs-member visibility | Not started |
| 8 | Spec doc + decision-gate write-up | Not started |

**Estimate:** 1–2 days.

**Decision gate at end of 16.7a:**
- Implementation ≤2 weeks → ship as **Sprint 16.7b pre-launch**
- Implementation >2 weeks → spec is shovel-ready; **punt 16.7b to v1.1 post-launch**

---

## Sprint 16.7b — Household Sharing Implementation (PUNTED to v1.1 post-launch)

**Decision (11 May 2026):** punted to **v1.1 post-launch**. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-sprint-16.7-household-sharing-design.md` is shovel-ready; implementation kicks off ~4-6 weeks after v1.0 launch as the headline feature of the first major update.

**Reasoning** (full version in spec §12):
- 11-day implementation estimate. Estimates run hot in this codebase (15.9 was 50% over, 16.1 trending similar). Realistic elapsed 15-18 days.
- Pre-launch already loaded with 16.6 + 16.8 + 17 + 18 + 19. Slotting 16.7b adds critical-path risk.
- Cloud Functions for `proActive` cheating prevention land in Sprint 17 — natural pairing if 16.7b ships post-launch alongside (rather than launching with a known security limitation in a marquee feature).
- Marketing benefit: dedicated "Elio now does household sharing" press moment vs. getting lost in launch noise.

**When work resumes:** writing-plans pass against the spec → Sprint 16.7b branch off whatever is `main` at the time.

---

## Sprint 16.7c — Browseable Library + Custom Aisles (Queued)

**Goal:** Decoupled from household sharing so it ships regardless of the 16.7a gate. Two competitor-analysis must-match gaps that don't depend on household infra.

| # | Task | Source | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Browseable saved-recipe library + collections** — UI repackaging of existing `users/{uid}/recipes/{id}` data (filter, sort, collections). Data exists; mostly merchandising | Competitor analysis must-match gap #3 | Not started |
| 2 | **User-customisable aisle ordering** — per-user `aisleOrder` on user doc. Lift Plan to Eat pattern; reviews tie it to long-term retention | Competitor analysis must-match gap #5 | Not started |

**Estimate:** 3–4 days.

---

## Sprint 16.8 — Email-Forward Order Import (Pre-Launch, in-flight)

**Goal:** Capture the growing online-grocery slice. User gets a unique elio inbox (`u_<token>@orders.eliochef.com`), forwards Instacart / Amazon Fresh / Tesco / Sainsbury's / Ocado / Kroger order confirmations, Elio parses line items into the pantry via the existing `InventoryWriter` (dedup-aware).

**Branch:** `feat/online-order-import` — design, plan, code complete (Postmark Inbound + 2 Cloud Functions + Gemini parser + review sheet UI). 31 tests green. Awaiting end-to-end real-email verification.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-25-online-order-import-design.md`
**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-online-order-import.md`

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Inbound email infra — Postmark Inbound chosen; MX on `orders.eliochef.com` (Hostinger DNS) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Per-user unique inbox `u_<13-char base32>@orders.eliochef.com` via `generateImportAddress` callable | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Cloud Function `postmarkInbound` — Basic Auth verify, SHA256 idempotency, write to `pending_imports` | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Email-to-pantry parser — Gemini structured output, retailer-agnostic | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Retailer regex table — Kroger / Fred Meyer / Tesco / Sainsbury's / Ocado / Walmart / Instacart / Amazon / Woolworths AU / Coles / Loblaws | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Settings UI — `OrderImportScreen` with Copy / Share, Pro-gated row in Preferences | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Pantry-tab dot badge + review sheet + apply flow via existing `InventoryWriter` | ✅ Done |
| 8 | End-to-end verification with a real grocery email (USER-GATE) — Kate's full A/B/C/D sweep on [the test sheet](https://www.notion.so/36d4718e358a8124bc6fd52f97b023a5) | In progress |
| 9 | **Postmark test-mode → approved (production)** — submit account approval to lift 100-email/month cap. Required before public launch. | Not started |
| 10 | Onboarding-friendly explainer — first-time discoverability | Infrastructure ✅ already shipped (generic `FeatureTipService` + bottom-sheet widget + catalogue + analytics via [PR #8](https://github.com/robchambo/elio-app/pull/8) → [PR #9 restore](https://github.com/robchambo/elio-app/pull/9), squash `10fa8a0`). Email-import tip entry deferred to v1.1 per spec §11. Adding later = one entry in `feature_tip_catalog.dart` + one `markFeatureUsed` call in the `OrderImportScreen` first-open path. |
| 11 | Domain rename audit — other `elio.app` references in `legal_links.dart`, paywall, onboarding strings still point at the placeholder domain | Not started |
| 12 | Spam / abuse guard — drop emails from unknown senders without an active forwarding rule (v1: bounce is implicit because unknown To: addresses return `{ignored: true}`; v1.1 might add explicit rate-limit + Postmark spam-filter tuning) | Deferred to v1.1 |

**Outstanding before launch:**
- Hostinger DNS: MX `orders.eliochef.com` → `inbound.postmarkapp.com`
- Postmark account approval (task #9 — currently 100-email cap in test mode)
- E2E verification with a real email (task #8)

**Why pre-launch (Rob's call, 11 May):** the moat extension over Samsung Food's smart-fridge integration — same job-to-be-done (track what you actually have at home) but reachable without locked-in hardware.

---

## Sprint 17 — Shared Launch Preparation

**Goal:** Everything that must be true before either store accepts a submission.

**Branch convention:** new `sprint/17-integration` cut **fresh** from `main`. Fix branches off it, no fold-back (per integration-branch scope-freeze rule). `origin/sprint-17` stale — delete after Sprint 17 lands.

**APK convention:** `S17--<DDmmm>-<letter>` (e.g. `S17--28may-a`). Filename `elio-S17--<DDmmm>-<letter>.apk`, label `0.S17--<DDmmm>-<letter>+<hash>`, tag `build/S17--<DDmmm>-<letter>`. Sub-sprints use `S17.<sub>--…`.

### Already shipped (counted under Sprint 17 umbrella)

| Area | What landed | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Performance audit | DevTools profiling, list optimisation, cold start parallelised | Sprint 15.3 |
| ErrorService coverage | ~15 call sites across 6 services | Sprint 15.5 |
| Firestore rules + entitlement hardening | `firestore.rules` default-deny, owner-only, protected sub-keys locked. `EntitlementService.refresh()` reads from RevenueCat at runtime. Dev Pro via `config/proTesters`. | On `main` via parallel commits (`5d26454` etc.) |
| Firestore rules deploy | Production deploy 16 May (unblocked `customItems`). Dry-run still passes. | `5d26454` |
| Crashlytics → Notion pipe (Tier 2) | 4 Cloud Functions idempotent-upsert into Operations → Crashes DB. **Supersedes the original Slack/Discord webhook plan.** | `functions/src/index.ts`, deployed us-east1 |
| GDPR — code services | `AccountService.deleteAccount()`, `DataExportService`, `LegalLinks` scaffolding | Wired into AccountScreen |
| Privacy / ToS — content + in-app screens | `assets/legal/privacy-policy.md` + `terms-of-service.md` + `wa-consumer-health-data-notice.md` (US/UK dual-regime); in-app `LegalDocScreen` reachable from AccountScreen About | Content authored, hosted URLs pending |
| `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` build wiring | `build.ps1` `--dart-define` pass-through (dry mode falls back) | Sprint 15.5 |

### Outstanding

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Email re-auth for Delete Account** — `account_screen.dart:570` `_reauthForDelete` only handles Google; email/password users get the support-email snackbar (line 588-599). Wire `EmailAuthProvider.credential(...)` mirroring Google branch. **Launch blocker** (Play Store + GDPR — in-app deletion across all auth methods). | 1–2 | Not started |
| 2 | **GDPR consent tracking** — sign-up checkbox + Settings withdrawal toggles (granular: analytics / crash reporting / marketing). Writes to `users/{uid}/consent` with timestamp. Satisfies GDPR Art. 7(3) withdrawal requirement. | 5–6 | Not started |
| 3 | **Privacy / ToS hosted URLs** — blocked on domain purchase (in flight). Once domain lands, Firebase Hosting on `elio-prototype`. Update `LegalLinks` to point at hosted URLs alongside in-app render. | 1 | Blocked on domain |
| 4 | **Server-side `weeklyGenerations` counter** — Cloud Fn proxies `generateRecipeStream` (HTTP SSE w/ manual ID-token verify), increments counter in Firestore transaction, enforces tier cap. Hides Gemini key from APK decompilation. Rules then lock `weeklyGenerations` + `weekStartedAt`. | 8–10 | Not started |
| 5 | **Emulator rule test suite** — `firebase emulators` + `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` proving default-deny / owner-only / protected-sub-keys-locked / pending_imports invariants. ~20 tests. | 3 | Not started |
| 6 | **GCP budget caps** — billing alert + hard-cap on `elio-prototype` project. Cloud Console only. | 0.5 | Not started |
| 7 | **RC live SKUs + key in `.env.local`** — create Play Store + App Store SKUs (7-day free trial), wire to RC dashboard, paste key into `.env.local`. | 2–3 | Partial (build.ps1 wired) |
| 8 | **Forgot Password on-device verification** — code wired since Sprint 15.x, never end-to-end confirmed. | 0.25 | Not verified |
| 9 | **Strip debug from `home_screen.dart`** — re-verify grep pre-build (no matches currently). | 0.25 | Likely done, verify pre-build |
| 10 | **Onboarding hero imagery — Kate finals** — replace `welcome_hero.png` (19 May interim resize) + `pantry_intro_hero.jpg` (visible AI typos `GRAAIN RICE`, `FANIFER`). Re-confirm no other placeholder. | 0.5 | Blocked on Kate art |
| 11 | **Cook Mode — wakelock for hands-free duration** — `wakelock_plus` currently held only while a timer is active. 21may-a `_updateWakelock()` attempt shipped a white-screen regression, reverted on 21may-b. Re-try via `initState`/`dispose` pair on `_handsFreeMode`, or `WidgetsBindingObserver.didChangeAppLifecycleState` resume re-assert. | 1–2 | Reverted, needs fresh attempt |
| 12 | **`functions/README.md`** — operator notes: deploy, `NOTION_TOKEN` rotation, schema-drift caveat (`index.ts:78-118`), regions split (us-central1 vs us-east1). | 0.5 | Not started |
| 13 | **Delete `proOverride` dead code** — `FirestoreService.grantProAccess()` + `revokeProAccess()` (`firestore_service.dart:597-606`) write `subscription.proOverride: true/false`. Rules already reject these writes (silent fail). Zero callers in `lib/`. Pure delete. (`proOverrideForTest` in `recipe_preferences_screen.dart` is a renamed test seam — keep.) | 0.25 | Not started |
| 14 | **Delete obsolete `origin/sprint-17` branch** — after Sprint 17 lands. | 0.1 | Not started |
| 15 | **Educational-tips batch** (three Style A `FeatureTipService` tips — kid-friendly chip, ingredient-substitute, Go Wild → add-to-shopping; one branch / one APK / one test pass, build after the next device-test pass clears). See the **Educational-tips batch spec** below this table. 15c carries a pending shopping-list gating decision. | 2 | Not started |
| 16 | **Recipe screen back nav → Set-the-mood, not Home** — currently back button from RecipeScreen (after generation) lands on Home, losing the user's craving / mode / saver / mealType selections. Should pop to `RecipePreferencesScreen` ("set the mood") so the user can tweak one thing and regen without re-entering everything. Likely a `Navigator.push` → `pushReplacement` swap on the prefs → recipe transition, or a custom `PopScope` on RecipeScreen intercepting the back gesture. Pair with row 15 batch — same testing pass. | 0.5 | Not started |
| 17 | **Guest → sign-in conversion** — make sign-in the prominent path for signed-out launches (Rob 28 May), with guest as an explicit option, plus contextual "sign in to keep this" nudges at guest value-moments. Replaces the current silent 16.1.x "signed-out lands on AppShell as guest" default. See the **Guest → sign-in conversion spec** below. Product decision logged; needs build. | 1–1.5d | Not started |
| 18 | **Guest pantry parity + builder tap-cycle UI** (Rob 28 May). Two coupled parts: (a) **guest pantry parity** — the in-app Pantry tab is guest-blind (display/add/remove all skip `GuestPantryService`; builder shows "Sign in to save", nothing persists) even though onboarding builds a guest pantry; wire read+add+remove to `GuestPantryService` for guests. (b) **builder tap-cycle UI** — replace long-press tier-picker with single-tap-cycle encoding the storage tier: `almostAlwaysHave` = outline, `alwaysHave` = solid fill, `perishable` = solid green. Staple lane cycles off→outline→solid; perishable lane is on/off green. Category fixes the lane. **(a) requires guest→sign-in pantry migration** (the parked `MigrationService` Task 6.4 only runs on the onboarding screen-15 path, not a later AccountScreen sign-in) — shipping (a) without it = guest builds pantry → signs in → pantry lost. See the **Guest pantry parity + builder UI spec** below. Pairs with row 17 (same guest-mode surface). | 1.5–2d | Not started |

**Estimate outstanding:** ~27–34 hours total (Claude code + Rob external + on-device verify). Of that, ~25–28h Claude-code work; ~5–6h Rob external (RC dashboard, GCP, hosting, Kate art when delivered).

### Educational-tips batch spec (roadmap row 15)

Two one-time tips on the existing Sprint 16.8 `FeatureTipService` (Style A bottom-sheet — `elio_feature_tip_sheet.dart`; no Style B spotlight needed/built). Both ship in one branch, one APK, one test pass. **Build trigger:** after the next on-device test pass clears (per Rob, not before). Design signed off 28 May 2026.

**Tip 15a — Kid-friendly chip nudge (NEW, household-gated).**
- **Trigger:** household audience signal = `household == 'family'` OR `householdCount > 2`, AND it's the user's **2nd** recipe-gen-screen visit (`sessionThreshold: 2`), AND they haven't already tapped the Kid-friendly chip (`markFeatureUsed` auto-suppresses). Audience gate lives at the `shouldShow` call site on the recipe-prefs screen — no `FeatureTipService` change (the service stays a generic usage-gap engine).
- **Host screen:** `recipe_preferences_screen.dart` ("set the mood"). Kid-friendly is a Mood chip (`_moodOptions[2]`, `:146`); it already drives a real Gemini branch (`gemini_service.dart:1623` → "recognisable to kids, not adventurous").
- **UI:** Style A bottom sheet. CTA **auto-selects** the chip (`_mood = 'Kid-friendly'`) rather than spotlighting it — cleaner than pointing at an on-screen chip the sheet covers.
- **Copy (signed off — variant A):** Title `Cooking for kids?` · Body `Tap Kid-friendly under Mood and we'll keep recipes simple, mild, and recognisable — food the little ones will actually eat.` · CTA `Use it`.
- **Catalog entry:** `id: kid_friendly_mood`, `requiredFeatureEvent: kid_friendly_mood_used` (fire `markFeatureUsed` from the chip's tap handler), `sessionThreshold: 2`.
- **Wiring to verify when building:** household signal availability at gen time for (a) signed-in users — `householdCount` from user doc, same source `home_screen.dart:250` reads; (b) guests mid-onboarding — `OnboardingController` / `GuestPantryService`. Confirm both before relying on the gate.

**Tip 15b — First-gen ingredient-substitute tip (teaches a gesture).**
- **Trigger:** lands on the recipe screen; `sessionThreshold` TBD at build (likely 1–2). Suppressed once the user long-presses an ingredient (`markFeatureUsed`).
- **Host screen:** recipe screen (`recipe_screen.dart`).
- **UI:** Style A "did-you-know" sheet. No auto-select CTA — it teaches the hidden long-press gesture (long-press ingredient → Substitute / Regen / Add-to-shopping). **Copy (signed off):** `Tip: long-press any ingredient to swap it.`
- **Catalog entry:** `id: ingredient_substitute`, `requiredFeatureEvent: ingredient_longpress_used`.

**Tip 15c — Go Wild → add-to-shopping tip (NEW, Rob 29 May).**
- **Trigger:** the user's **first Go Wild generation**. Go Wild zeroes pantry-sourced fields, so the recipe will likely use ingredients they don't have — the moment to surface the "add to shopping list" button.
- **Host screen:** recipe screen (where the Go Wild recipe lands + where the add-to-shopping cart button lives, `recipe_screen.dart:2933`).
- **UI:** Style A bottom sheet. CTA points at / triggers the add-to-shopping action.
- **Copy (draft, confirm at build):** Title `Don't have it all?` · Body `Go Wild recipes look beyond your pantry — so you might be missing a few things. Tap the cart to send what you need to your shopping list.` · CTA `Add to shopping list`.
- **Catalog entry:** `id: gowild_add_to_shopping`, `requiredFeatureEvent: recipe_add_to_shopping_used`, fired on first Go Wild recipe view (gate the `shouldShow` call on "this generation was Go Wild").
- **⚠️ GATING DECISION PENDING (Rob, 29 May).** Rob assumed shopping list is Pro and the tip would need gating. **Code reality differs:** the shopping-list tab + the recipe-screen `_addToShoppingList` are gated on **guest only** (signed-in free users can use them); only the meal-plan→shopping path is Pro (`canUseShoppingList`). EntitlementService's intent ("Free tier: no shopping list") is NOT enforced on these paths. So before building 15c, decide:
  - **(a) Shopping list = Pro** → close the gating gap on recipe add-to-shopping + the shopping tab; 15c then upsells free users (CTA → paywall). Also a monetisation-leak fix.
  - **(b) Shopping list = free** → no gating; 15c just educates everyone; **correct the free-vs-Pro HTML** (`docs/strategy/2026-05-28-free-vs-pro-features.html`) which currently lists shopping list as Pro.

**Shared build notes:** each tip = one `FeatureTipCatalog` entry + one `markFeatureUsed` call at the feature's tap/long-press site + one `shouldShow` call on the host screen (15a's gated behind the household check). No new dependency. Pairs naturally with row 16 (recipe back-nav) for the same testing pass.

### Guest → sign-in conversion spec (roadmap row 17)

**Decision (Rob, 28 May 2026):** stop letting signed-out users land silently in guest mode. Sign-in should be the prominent surface; guest stays available but as an explicit choice. Plus nudge guests to sign in at the moment they create something worth keeping. Direction set; copy + final UX to confirm at build.

**Current behaviour (the problem).** `AuthGate` (`main.dart`) routes on the `onboardingComplete` SharedPreferences flag only: `true` → `AppShell`, which runs in guest mode whenever `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser == null` (HomeScreen computes `isGuest = currentUser == null`). So a signed-out user — whether a deliberate guest or someone who just signed out — silently gets the guest AppShell. There is **no flag distinguishing a deliberate guest from a signed-out returner**, and guest state is device-local (the cross-account / count bugs fixed in S17--28may-d were downstream of this).

**Part A — signed-out entry routing.** Add a persistent `hasAccount` SharedPreferences bool: set `true` on the first successful sign-in (any provider), cleared only by Delete Account + Restart Onboarding (NOT by sign-out). Then `AuthGate` branches the signed-out case:
- `onboardingComplete && currentUser != null` → `AppShell` (signed in). *Unchanged.*
- `onboardingComplete && currentUser == null && hasAccount` → **returner**: route to the **sign-in screen** (reuse `EmailLoginScreen` / a sign-in landing) with a prominent **"Continue as guest"** escape. They had an account — bring them back.
- `onboardingComplete && currentUser == null && !hasAccount` → **deliberate guest**: `AppShell` as today, BUT show a one-time-per-launch **Home sign-in sheet** — "Sign in to save your pantry, recipes & plans" with primary **Sign in** + secondary **Continue as guest** (dismiss → stays guest). Not a wall.
- `!onboardingComplete` → `OnboardingFlow`. *Unchanged.*

(This maps Rob's two options onto the two cases: returner gets the sign-in screen; fresh guest gets the home pop-up with guest as an option.)

**Part B — contextual "sign in to keep" nudge.** At guest value-moments, surface a lightweight sheet whose CTA goes to sign-in:
- After a guest generates / saves a recipe → "Sign in to keep this recipe."
- After a guest adds pantry items → "Sign in to save your pantry."
One nudge per moment-type per session; suppressed once signed in. Dedicated auth sheet (not `FeatureTipService` — this is conversion, not feature-discovery), brand-styled.

### Guest pantry parity + builder UI spec (roadmap row 18)

**Decision (Rob, 28 May 2026):** guest should have a fully functional local pantry (build → edit → generate), with the "sign in to keep" nudge (row 17) as the conversion lever — not a wall. Confirmed worth doing; flagged as a 2-part job because (a) without (b) is a regression trap.

**The bug (part a — guest pantry parity).** The in-app Pantry tab is guest-blind:
- **Display** — `pantry_screen.dart:162` `_subscribeInventory` returns early when `currentUser == null`; never reads `GuestPantryService`. Guest pantry shows empty even though onboarding populated it.
- **Add** — builder `onAddItem` (`:752`) calls `_firestore.addInventoryItem` → `InventoryWriter` returns "" for guests → "Sign in to save items to your pantry." snackbar, nothing persists.
- **Remove** — Firestore-only.

`GuestPantryService` already has the storage: `saveStaples(Map<String,String>)` / `savePerishables(Map<String,String>)` / `loadAll() → GuestPantrySnapshot` / `clear`, keyed `guest_staples` + `guest_perishables`. **Fix:** branch all three pantry-tab operations on `currentUser == null`:
- guest read → `loadAll()` → map staples (always/usually) + perishables (fresh/this-week/today) into the `_items` shape the tab renders. SharedPrefs is not a stream — load once + listen on a guest pantry change-notifier (mirror the existing `householdCountChanges` `ValueNotifier` pattern) instead of `query.snapshots()`.
- guest add → mutate the right map (staple tier → `saveStaples`; perishable → `savePerishables`) + save + reload.
- guest remove → drop from the right map + save + reload.

**Migration dependency (part a's blocker).** `MigrationService` runs guest→Firestore only on the **onboarding screen-15 sign-in** path. A guest who edits the pantry in-app *after* onboarding, then signs in later via AccountScreen → `EmailLoginScreen`, does **not** get those edits migrated. Shipping guest pantry parity without closing this = guest builds a pantry → signs in → it vanishes (worse than the current "sign in to save" dead-end). So row 18 must also run `MigrationService` (or an equivalent guest-pantry adopt) on **any** sign-in where a guest pantry exists, merging into Firestore inventory (dedup against existing — `inventory_deduped_v1` logic already exists).

**The UI change (part b — builder tap-cycle).** Replace the pantry-builder long-press tier-picker dialog with a single-tap-cycle whose visual encodes the **storage tier** (Rob 29 May — the axis is restock-habit, not freshness). Two independent cues: fill *style* encodes the staple sub-tier, fill *colour* (green) flags perishable.

**Visual language (one state per tier):**
- `almostAlwaysHave` → **outline** (brand colour)
- `alwaysHave` → **solid fill** (brand colour)
- `perishable` → **solid fill, green**

**Tap behaviour — cycle length depends on the item's lane:**
- **Staple item** → `off → outline → solid → off` (cycles the 2 staple tiers, like onboarding screen 11).
- **Perishable item** → `off → green solid → off` (on/off only — no sub-tier).

**Lane is category-fixed** (already mapped — same logic as the order-import `_tierFor`): perishable categories (produce/dairy/meat/bakery) → perishable lane; the rest → staple lane. The builder picks the cycle per tile without asking. No cross-lane re-tiering (a perishable tile can't become "always have") — matches onboarding's split-screen model; revisit only if a long-press escape hatch is wanted later.

**Legend:** `elio_pantry_tier_legend.dart` (shared with onboarding) must be updated to show outline / solid / green-solid, not the freshness legend. Drop the long-press `RawGestureDetector` tier-picker.

**Rejected:** mapping onboarding's green/orange/red freshness ramp onto the 3 storage tiers — freshness (how soon it expires) and restock-tier (how often you keep it stocked) are different axes; conflating them mislabels "always-have soy sauce" as "fresh/green."

**Critical dependency — the "keep" promise must be real.** `MigrationService.migrateGuestToFirestore(uid, …)` already carries guest pantry + state into Firestore on sign-in, but today it runs from the **onboarding screen-15** path. The in-app sign-in paths (Settings → Sign In tile → `EmailLoginScreen`, and the new entry/keep sheets) MUST also run migration so a guest's recipes/pantry actually transfer on sign-in — otherwise "sign in to keep this" loses the very thing it promised. **Verify + wire migration on every sign-in entry point** as part of this work.

**Surfaces:** `main.dart` AuthGate branch · new `hasAccount` flag (set in `AuthService` / `MigrationService` sign-in success path) · sign-in landing (new or `EmailLoginScreen` + "Continue as guest" CTA) · Home one-time guest sheet · keep-nudge sheet at recipe-save + pantry-add guest paths · migration wired on in-app sign-in.

**Edge cases:** don't wall deliberate guests every launch (the one-time sheet, not a hard gate); don't lose guest work on sign-in (migration); account-switch merges guest→signing-in account (pre-launch acceptable, revisit with 16.7b household sharing).

**Estimate:** 1–1.5 days. Confirm copy for the entry sheet + both keep-nudges before building.

**Items punted from Sprint 17 → see Notion Launch Checklist** for the wider pre-launch backlog (referral loop, push campaigns, in-app review, analytics → BigQuery, a11y audit, app icon ratify, first-run coach marks, Gemini model audit, regional ingredient vocabulary, etc). Those are not store-submission blockers — they land in v1.1 or as pre-launch polish only if Sprint 17 outstanding closes early.

## Post-Launch Backlog (Prioritised)

### v1.1 — from competitor analysis (early post-launch)

| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P1** | **Sprint 16.7b — Real Household Sharing** (headline v1.1 feature) | Multi-UID household with full data sharing (inventory, shopping, meal plan), 6-digit code invites, owner's Pro extends to up to 6 members. Competitor-analysis must-match gap #1. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-sprint-16.7-household-sharing-design.md`. **~11 days implementation** + Sprint 17 Cloud Function dependencies (RC webhook, monthly sweep, cascade-delete sweep — 2.5-3 days incremental). |
| P1 | **Apple Watch app** | Read-only shopping list with check-off. Three of four shopping-list competitors have it; AnyList + OurGroceries reviewers cite as top-3 feature. |
| 🚫 Blocked | **Google Assistant add-to-list (Android)** | Originally targeted as Android counterpart to Siri Shortcuts. **Blocked** — Google sunset Conversational Actions in June 2023 with no replacement third-party write API for the Assistant shopping list; Gemini-the-Assistant has no public extension submission process either (partner integrations only). Confirmed unworkable 21 May 2026 via the [shopping-list-sync research](https://www.notion.so/3654718e358a800ba458fffcec60d67e). Re-evaluate only if Google ships a developer platform for the next-gen Assistant. |
| P1 | **Free-tier shopping list** (single list, no household, no recipe-link) | Widens conversion funnel. OurGroceries gives full list free; Elio's all-or-nothing gating may cap free-to-paid. |
| P2 | **Wider recipe-import site coverage** | Top-50 cooking domains with validated parsers as fallback to Vision OCR. AnyList + Plan to Eat publish supported-domain lists. |
| P2 | **Alexa skill** | Add via Alexa Skills Kit List Management API (`POST /v2/householdlists/.../items`) with a Lambda/HTTPS webhook writing to Firestore. Confirmed P2 post-launch on 21 May 2026 after the broader [shopping-list-sync research](https://www.notion.so/3654718e358a800ba458fffcec60d67e) closed off all Android voice paths — Alexa is the only non-iOS smart-speaker integration that's still possible. Expected adoption: niche but real for Echo households. **Dev prerequisite:** pick up a used Echo Dot (~$20) before starting. Cert iteration is ~1 week per cycle and Amazon's reviewers test on real devices, so simulator-only dev means flying blind on device-only bugs. |
| P2 | **Feature-tip system polish + catalogue expansion** | The `FeatureTipService` shipped Sprint 16.8 (commit `10fa8a0`) is currently Style A bottom-sheets with two pilot tips (Recipe Import, Meal Plan → Shopping). Post-launch polish pass: (a) **Style B spotlight coach-marks** (`showcaseview` dep, `GlobalKey`-based targeting) for the gesture features where spatial highlighting matters — Cook Mode timer-number taps, long-press ingredient chip → Substitute/Regen, long-press pantry chip → Running Low. (b) **Catalogue expansion** — add tips for Bulk Prep toggle, Makeable-Now filter, Side Dish suggestion, bookmark-from-history, barcode/receipt scanner edit affordances (full ~11-feature backlog from the Sprint 16.8 discoverability survey). (c) **Backfill `logFeatureUsed(...)` events** across every candidate feature so the v1.1 catalogue expansion has real analytics to target by ("which features actually get missed"). (d) **Settings → "Show me tips again"** debug/reset toggle that wipes `seenTips` (both local SharedPrefs `seen_tip_*` keys + the Firestore field), so testers + users who want to re-explore can. Trivial — one button + a `FeatureTipService.resetAllSeen()` method. Plan/test procedure already exists at https://www.notion.so/36c4718e358a818fb69cf414a3d143d2 — extend it for the new entries. |

### v1.2 — competitor analysis (data-driven post-launch)

| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P1** | **Cloud-sync saved recipes** | Saved recipes currently live in SharedPreferences only (`HistoryService`, key `elio_recipe_history`) — device-local, no Firestore mirror. Sign in on a fresh device and your history is gone; clear-data wipes it; reinstall wipes it. Mirror to `users/{uid}/savedRecipes/{savedAt}` (or include in household sharing in 16.7b). Likely also explains some "where did my recipes go?" feedback during on-device testing. |
| P2 | **Multiple lists** (groceries, Costco, hardware) | AnyList + Bring! + OurGroceries + Plan to Eat all support. Generalize shopping-list model. After household sharing lands. |
| P2 | **Recurring lists / templates** | "Weekly staples" template that clones to active list. AnyList + OurGroceries have. |
| P2 | **Family pricing tier** ($X/yr household, AnyList-style at $14.99/yr) | After Sprint 16.7 household sharing proves out. Match AnyList structure. |
| P2 | **Per-store aisle layouts** ("my Trader Joe's, my Whole Foods") | After basic custom aisle ordering (16.7c) proves out. Plan to Eat's stickiness driver. |
| P3 | **Geofence "at the store" reminders** | Bring!-style. Niche-loved; battery + permission friction. |

### Carry-over from existing backlog

| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| P1 | Accurate cost estimation | Supermarket API integration for real pricing |
| P1 | Regional language localisation | courgette/zucchini, coriander/cilantro, etc. |
| P2 | Grocery affiliate integration | Shopping list → delivery service |
| P2 | Social sharing | Recipe card as shareable image |
| P2 | Recipe ratings & feedback loop | Like/dislike influences future generation (internal adaptive learning already shipped — this is the user-visible surface) |
| P3 | Multilingual support | Full app translation |
| P3 | Tablet/web layout optimisation | Responsive layouts for larger screens |
| P3 | Offline mode | Cache recent recipes, local-first pantry for all users |

### Small loose ends from memory + earlier sprints

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Onboarding screens 06–15 still using `ElioHeroHeading` wrapper | Migrate to `ElioPageTitle` directly |
| Legacy `ElioTextStyles` aliases cleanup + delete `ElioHeroHeading` wrapper | Sweep callers, delete aliases |
| Per-pantry-item dietary metadata pass | ~100+ items in `PantryCategories.all` need per-item dietary tags (content authoring, Kate-voice decision on hide vs grey) |
| Screen 11/12 search bar | Deferred from Sprint 16.2; reassess after on-device feedback |
| Screen 10 hero illustration | Kate art (currently placeholder) |
| Coordinator-owned single progress bar | Replace per-screen progress bars (minor visual refactor) |
| Sprint 18 original (App Check + server-side Gemini migration) | Deferred — original sprint number reused for Android track |
| Widen `TimeParser` regex to cover ranges + natural language | Sprint 16.6 v1 deliberately excluded ranges ("5–10 minutes"), decimals ("1.5 hours"), and natural-language ("about an hour", "half an hour"). Cook Mode on-device testing surfaced a real recipe with a duration that wasn't matched. Cheapest wins: ranges (default to lower bound) and "about/around N". |
| Restore "Generate Recipe with These" auto-generation after scan | 19 May 2026 (`fix/scan-success-naked-pantry-push`): both ScanSuccessScreen CTAs used to push naked PantryScreen / HomeScreen via MaterialPageRoute, bypassing AppShell's Scaffold and rendering on a black background. Fixed by popping to root, but the lost feature is HomeScreen receiving `scannedItems` for auto-generation. Restore via an AppShell hook (e.g. `initialPendingScannedItems` constructor param, or a singleton `AppShellController` that lets external screens switch tabs + push state). Sprint 17. |

## Known Issues

- `google-services.json` not in git — must be added manually after fresh clone
- Dev flavor broken — always use `--flavor prod`
- iOS URL scheme placeholder needs filling before any iOS build
- APK size 72.9 MB (mobile_scanner ML Kit) — may need app bundles for Play Store
- `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` not in `.env.local` (tracked under Sprint 17 outstanding #7)
