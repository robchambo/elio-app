# Elio Roadmap

**Last updated:** 26 May 2026 (Sprint 16.8 row 7 flipped to ⚠️ Infrastructure shipped — generic `FeatureTipService` landed on `main` via PRs #8 + #9 with 2 pilot tips; email-import-specific tip catalogue entry deferred until that vendor work lands. Added P2 v1.1 row: feature-tip polish + Style B spotlight + catalogue expansion.)

**Active branch:** `sprint/16-integration` — main integration line. Topic branch `fix/flash-lite-streaming` (1 commit ahead) ready to merge.
**Pushed to origin:** through `041a915` on `sprint/16-integration`; `c58c924` pushed on `fix/flash-lite-streaming` after on-device sign-off.

**Recent (1–15 May 2026):**
- Sprint 15.9.2 — Gemini warmup (cold-start reliability)
- Dietary/allergen safety audit (8+ commits on `sprint/16`) — major pre-launch risk closed
- Sprint 16.1 — Settings Redesign (4-section tree, unified dietary plumbing)
- Sprint 16.1.x — Auth UX fix (Sign In tile, Restart Onboarding, sign-out preserves onboardingComplete)
- **Streaming model swap (15 May 2026)** — recipe-generation hot path moved `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` after a head-to-head eval (`tool/eval/run.dart` × 5 fixtures on `claude/compare-gemini-models-9in2t`). Flash-Lite matched Flash on TTFT, beat it on total stream time (~1 s faster), cost (~83% cheaper), and structural pass rate. Prewarm call also swapped to match. Subjectively "noticeably quicker" on-device with no quality regression. Branch `fix/flash-lite-streaming`, commit `c58c924`, APK tag `build/sprint-16-integration-flash-lite`.

**Sprint 16.4 polish (April 2026):**
- Bug 4 — Pantry single-tap removed (long-press only); Remove lives in the long-press picker.
- Bug 5 — Home Recent Recipes pushed below the fold via LayoutBuilder.
- Bug 6 — Recipes-tab filters (search, makeable-now, category chips) removed; TODO flag for revisit.
- Bug 3 — Per-tier "+ Add" chip on Pantry tab; perishables get a freshness-bucket follow-up.
- Bug 1 — EntitlementService.refresh() kicked off on Home initState so Plan-your-week appears on cold start.
- Bug 2 — Top-3 most-urgent perishables auto-selected in PerishablesPickerScreen (default; overridable).
- Bonus — Recipes-tab "Take photo" / "Manual entry" bento cards now wire to the live RecipeImportScreen with the right initial tab (photo import was already built, just unwired).

## Launch Strategy

**Goal:** Launch Android and iOS together. Android builds first and may reach production a few days earlier, but both platforms are worked toward a coordinated public release. No dedicated "Android-only" launch — iOS parity is part of the launch deliverable.

Work is grouped into three parallel tracks:
1. **Shared platform work** (security, legal, assets, regression) — blocks both stores.
2. **Android track** — Play Console, internal testing, staged rollout.
3. **iOS track** — Xcode config, Apple Sign-In, Siri Shortcuts, TestFlight, App Store review.

## Sprint 15.4 — Recipe Book & Shopping List Improvements ✅

**Goal:** Strengthen the two areas identified in competitor analysis — recipe organisation and shopping list intelligence.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|

| 2 | Recipe Book — "Makeable now" filter (cross-reference saved recipes vs current pantry) | 1–2 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Shopping list — Ingredient quantity consolidation (combine "1 cup flour" + "2 cups flour" = "3 cups") | 2–3 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Shopping list — Aisle-based grouping (Produce, Meat & Fish, Dairy, Bakery, etc.) | 2–3 | ✅ Done |
| 5 | URL recipe import — import from URL on Recipe Book import screen | 1 | ✅ Done |

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Google Sign-In SHA-1 fix for new devices | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Paywall appearing unexpectedly — audit trigger logic | 1–2 | ✅ Done (audited — all 4 triggers properly gated, no issue found) |
| 3 | Notification service — wire `requestPermissionAndRegister()` to a trigger | 1 | ✅ Done (`init()` at startup, permission request on first HomeScreen load) |
| 4 | Paywall integration tests — update stale assertions from trial-first rewrite | 1 | ✅ Done (headlines updated to match context-based copy) |
| 5 | RevenueCat API key — wire through `build.ps1` / `.env.local` | 1 | ✅ Done (optional — warns in dry mode, passes via `--dart-define`) |
| 6 | `ErrorService` coverage — add to GeminiService, FirestoreService, VoiceControlService, PurchaseService | 1–2 | ✅ Done (~15 new call sites across 6 services) |

---

## Sprint 15.6 — Side Dishes, Shopping UX & Bug Fixes ✅

**Goal:** New side dish feature, shopping list UX improvements, and bug fixes from on-device testing.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Shopping cart badge — show only non-pantry ingredient count | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Meal plan shopping — confirmation dialog with editable items, select/deselect, "View shopping list" link | 2 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Recipe screen shopping — same confirmation dialog for individual recipe add-to-shopping | 1.5 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Purge residual staples (water/salt) from Firestore shopping items | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Meal plan timeout fix — HTTP timeouts (90s/60s/45s), token budget 4096→6144, staggered progress messages | 1.5 | ✅ Done |

| 9 | build.ps1 — auto-find flutter when not on PATH | 0.5 | ✅ Done |

**Build:** `elio-sprint-15.6.apk` (72.9 MB)

---

## Sprint 15.7 — Shopping Share & Unit Abbreviations ✅

**Goal:** Share shopping list, abbreviate ingredient units, fix pantry builder tier picker.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Shopping list share button — formats unchecked items by aisle, shares via system share sheet | 1 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Unit abbreviations — `QuantityUtils.normalizeUnit()` maps "grams"→"g", "millilitres"→"ml" etc. across all recipe screen display locations | 1 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Pantry Builder tier picker — changed `showModalBottomSheet` → `showDialog` (nested sheet was failing silently) | 0.5 | ✅ Done |

**Build:** `elio-sprint-15.7.apk` (72.9 MB)

---

## Sprint 15.8 — Bug Fixes & UX Polish ✅

**Goal:** Fix remaining bugs found during on-device testing.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Pantry Builder long-press — removed guard that blocked tier change for items already in pantry | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Bookmark toggle on imported recipes — `_savedAt` now captured on auto-save so toggle works | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Back button touch targets — added 8px padding to all 7 bare `GestureDetector` back buttons across screens | 0.5 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Household member delete — 350ms delay after sheet dismiss before opening confirmation dialog (animation race condition) | 0.5 | ✅ Done |

**Build:** `elio-sprint-15.8.apk` (72.9 MB)

---

## Sprint 15.9 — Personalised Pantry Builder ✅ (April 2026)

**Goal:** Memory-driven pantry builder — surface what users have actually had via tierMemory, custom items, and inventory backfill. Universal staples (salt, pepper, water, sugar, generic oils) excluded; dietary conflicts greyed.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract PantryStaples utility from ShoppingService | ✅ |
| 2 | PantryMemoryEntry model | ✅ |
| 3 | PantryMemoryService — read paths (recentUsuals, hadBeforeKeys, customsByCategory) | ✅ |
| 4 | PantryMemoryService — write paths (upsertCustom, backfillFromInventoryIfNeeded) | ✅ |
| 5 | showAddPantryItemDialog blocks staples with inline note | ✅ |
| 6 | Builder sheet — "Your usuals" section + tier-defaulting | ✅ |
| 7 | Builder sheet — had-before dots + customs-first chips + dietary greying | ✅ |
| 8 | Pantry-screen wiring of upsertCustom | ✅ |
| 9 | Docs (CLAUDE.md + roadmap.md) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/15.9-personalized-pantry`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-sprint-15.9-personalized-pantry-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-30-sprint-15.9-personalized-pantry.md`.

---

## Sprint 15.9.1 — Inventory Dedup ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Stop `FirestoreService.addInventoryItem` creating duplicate Firestore docs when a user re-imports an item via any path. Existing rows update; tier sticks (existing wins); perishable expiry refreshes; `lastPurchasedAt` always refreshes.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract PantryStringMatch utility from ShoppingService._singularise | ✅ |
| 2 | InventoryWriter skeleton + storage interface + fake | ✅ |
| 3 | InventoryWriter.addItem with dedup + tier-sticky rule book | ✅ |
| 4 | Lazy migration of legacy rows on first addItem | ✅ |
| 5 | FirestoreService.addInventoryItem delegates to InventoryWriter | ✅ |
| 6 | Docs (CLAUDE.md schema + roadmap.md) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/15.9.1-inventory-dedup`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-sprint-15.9.1-inventory-dedup-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-01-sprint-15.9.1-inventory-dedup.md`.

---

## Sprint 16 — UI Overhaul — COMPLETE (April 2026, pending minor bug tweaks)

All 4 ready-for-dev screens (Home, Pantry, Recipe, Dietary) plus stretch screens (Shopping, Recipe Book, Account, Recipe Preferences, Paywall, Meal Plan, Hands-Free, Onboarding) shipped with the new Elio design system. 17 widgets in `lib/widgets/elio/`, 3 new token files in `lib/theme/`, 25/25 tests passing.

**Not tagged yet** — Rob has minor bug tweaks outstanding. Tag `v0.16.0-ui-overhaul` after those + on-device verification.

### Sprint 16b — Onboarding rebuild (branch: `sprint/16-onboarding-rebuild`, pushed 20 Apr)

15-screen, sell-to-self, sign-in-deferred onboarding. Replaces the legacy 8-screen sign-in-first flow. All pre-auth state lives in `OnboardingController` (ChangeNotifier) + `GuestPantryService` (SharedPreferences); `MigrationService` handles guest→Firestore on screen 15 sign-in.

**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-onboarding-rebuild.md` (7 phases, ~31 tasks)
**Specs:** `docs/onboarding/00-overview.md` + `01-welcome.md` → `15-account.md`
**Progress:** 42 commits, 239 tests passing, `flutter analyze` clean. APK `releases/elio-sprint-16.1-onboarding.apk` (71.7 MB).

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | State delta + controller + guest-pantry + AuthGate inversion + 11 widgets + palette tokens | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Screens 01 welcome, 02 goal, 03 household, 04 dietary (w/ Option B household union) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Screen 05 allergies & dislikes | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Screens 06 time, 07 confidence, 08 appliances, 09 region & units | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Screens 10 pantry intro, 11 staples, 12 perishables | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Screen 13 first-recipe demo + Gemini ephemeral entry point | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Paywall (14, goal-keyed headlines) + Account (15, sign-in deferred) + MigrationService full impl + PurchaseService.aliasToUid | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Coordinator `onboarding_flow.dart` + analytics wiring + APK build | ✅ Done |

**In flight: Sprint 16.2 — Copy polish pass** (stays on `sprint/16-onboarding-rebuild`, not a separate sprint). Screen-by-screen walkthrough of copy on 01 → 15: spec `.md` + screen `.dart` kept in lockstep, commit per screen. Flag conditional variants (screens 05/07/10/13/14).

**Progress (22 Apr → 18 May):** Screens 03 (household), 04 (dietary), 05 (allergies), 06 (time), 07 (confidence), 08 (appliances, 3-col grid + tighter tiles), 09 (region — post-override helper dropped) all polished + committed. Screen 10 reviewed, illustration flagged for Kate. Screens 11/12 got the v1 "+ Add something" per-category tile with dedup (exact-match silent promote / fuzzy-match confirm via `PantryUtils.findDuplicates`) — shipped `feat(sprint-16-onboarding): + Add something tile on screens 11/12 with dedup`. Screens 13 (first-recipe demo), 14 (paywall), 15 (account) walked + committed — copy verified against spec on 18 May; specs have explicit `Sprint 16.2 notes / Sprint 16.2 update` sections recording the polish decisions that shipped (per-goal headlines, region-aware takeaway variant, feature comparison addition, tappable Terms + Privacy footer, "coming soon" toasts for Apple + Email).

**Then:** on-device smoke test → tag `v16.1-onboarding-rebuild` → merge to `sprint/16`.

**Open items (non-blocking):**
- Screen 11 default count: 20 vs spec "~16" prose.
- Palette tokens `freshGreen`/`perishToday`/`perishThisWeek` placeholder hex — Kate to ratify.
- Screen 10 hero illustration placeholder (🧊) — Kate art.
- Screen 11/12 search bar not built (flagged later after on-device feedback).
- Screen 11/12 full dietary/allergy filtering beyond default-exclude — deferred: needs per-item metadata pass on ~100+ `PantryCategories` items (content authoring, Kate-voice decision on hide vs grey).
- Coordinator uses per-screen progress bars rather than a single coordinator-owned bar (minor visual refactor).
- ~~**Bulk Prep on the recipe prefs screen — Kate design pass.**~~ Dropped 2026-05-17 (Rob). Current prefs screen has Saver + Leftover only; the dedicated `BulkPrepResultsScreen` flow (Pro) is the way in for now. Revisit only if user feedback specifically asks for a Bulk-Prep entry from prefs.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Design system finalised — colours, typography, spacing, component specs | 2–3 | Done |
| 2 | Home screen — visual refresh | 2–3 | Done |
| 3 | Recipe screen — visual refresh | 1–2 | Done |
| 4 | Profile / pantry / recipe book — visual refresh | 2–3 | Done |
| 5 | Onboarding — visual refresh | 1–2 | Done |
| 6 | Paywall — visual refresh | 1 | Done |
| 7 | Cross-app consistency pass + cleanup | 1–2 | Done |

---

## Sprint 15.9.2 — Gemini Cold-Start Warmup ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Address the known "Gemini first-attempt fails after app launch" reliability issue. Pre-warm the Flash connection at app launch + on Home so the first user-facing recipe generation doesn't pay the cold-start tax.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `GeminiService.prewarmConnection()` — fire-and-forget at app launch | ✅ |
| 2 | Home initState pre-warms on top of app-launch warmup (idempotent) | ✅ |
| 3 | Onboarding screen 12 calls warmup defensively before screen 13 transition | ✅ |
| 4 | Fix `MAX_TOKENS` no longer breaking recipe generation (related, batched together) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/15.9.2-gemini-warmup` (pushed). Covers every entry path — onboarding screen 13, returning-user Home Generate, post-background warm-starts.

---

## Sprint 16 — Dietary/Allergen Safety Audit ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Close the highest-priority pre-launch risk — silent allergen/dietary failures. Pre-fix: peanuts could land in recipes for nut-allergic users, dietary constraints could be silently dropped, auto-save failures could surface as ghost settings, and AuthGate's Firestore fallback didn't cover the no-network case. Eight commits on `sprint/16` after the 16.4 polish that hardened the food-safety stack end-to-end.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Allergens silently dropped — root cause + hard fix in prompt assembly | ✅ |
| 2 | Auto-save was silently failing — three failure modes closed (verify-after-save, force-refresh, canonicalisation) | ✅ |
| 3 | Post-gen allergen filter + craving-override prompt | ✅ |
| 4 | Allergen filter singular/plural — "peanuts" and "peanut" both match | ✅ |
| 5 | AuthGate Firestore fallback for the no-local-flag case | ✅ |
| 6 | Allergen exclusion hoisted to a position-1 safety preamble in the Gemini prompt | ✅ |
| 7 | Time preference now drives recipe ambition | ✅ |
| 8 | Prompt audit fixes — appliances, mood, runningLow, default creative, dedup | ✅ |
| 9 | Verify-after-save read-back surfaces silent server denial | ✅ |
| 10 | Stamp request constraints onto `recipe.dietaryTags` (pill honesty) | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/16` (pushed). Testing protocol: `docs/strategy/2026-05-06-allergen-testing-procedure.html` + `docs/strategy/2026-05-07-weekend-test-protocol.html`. Weekend on-device verification scheduled.

**Why this matters:** Competitor analysis (`docs/strategy/2026-05-03-competitor-analysis.html`) flagged DishGen's hallucination failure mode — "peanuts in recipes for allergic users" — as Elio's existential risk. This audit closes it before launch.

---

## Sprint 16.1 — Settings Redesign ✅ (May 2026)

**Goal:** Replace the legacy single-list "Account" screen with a four-section iOS-style Settings tree (Household / Preferences / Account / About). Unify dietary plumbing as a single source of truth with reactive sync so changes propagate from Settings → generation without manual refresh.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | 4-section Settings tree (Household / Preferences / Account / About) | ✅ |
| 2 | Inline segmented controls for Measurement Units + Region (no sub-screen) | ✅ |
| 3 | Inline switch for Saver Mode default (writes to user doc) | ✅ |
| 4 | Account section: Manage Subscription + Restore Purchases + Sign Out + Delete Account | ✅ |
| 5 | About section: Privacy Policy + Terms of Service (in-app `LegalDocScreen`) + Export My Data + Send Feedback + App Version | ✅ |
| 6 | Drop the "Food Style" tile (per Rob's review of the spec) | ✅ |
| 7 | GDPR services (`AccountService.deleteAccount`, `DataExportService.exportData`) wired | ✅ |
| 8 | Send Feedback dialog with support email + tap-to-copy | ✅ |
| 9 | Unified dietary plumbing — single source of truth + reactive sync from Settings → generation | ✅ |
| 10 | Canonicalise lowercase onboarding tokens on read (drift between onboarding capture and Settings) | ✅ |
| 11 | Shopping list snackbar lifecycle (dismiss on time + on View tap) | ✅ |
| 12 | Appliances case-mismatch fix in Settings → Kitchen Appliances flow | ✅ |

**Branch:** `sprint/16.1-settings-redesign` (pushed through `55a144f`). Spec: `docs/strategy/Elio settings.docx`. File: `lib/screens/account/account_screen.dart` (rendered title is "settings.", file name kept for AppShell top-bar routing stability).

**Pending:** on-device weekend test pass per `docs/strategy/2026-05-07-weekend-test-protocol.html` → tag → merge to `sprint/16`.

---

## Sprint 16.1.x — Auth UX Fix ✅ (11 May 2026)

**Goal:** Fix the three-way trap blocking signed-out testing and confusing real users: (a) no Sign In path outside the 15-screen onboarding flow, (b) Sign Out wiped `onboardingComplete` forcing re-onboarding, (c) no deliberate "I want to walk onboarding again" action distinct from Sign Out.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract `performSignOut` + `performRestartOnboarding` to `lib/screens/account/account_actions.dart` — pure top-level helpers with injected callbacks for unit testability | ✅ |
| 2 | `performSignOut` no longer wipes `onboardingComplete` — user lands on AppShell as guest after sign-out | ✅ |
| 3 | AccountScreen Account section: conditional "Sign In" tile (guest only, pushes `EmailLoginScreen`); Sign Out + Delete hidden for guests | ✅ |
| 4 | AccountScreen About section: new "Restart Onboarding" action with confirm dialog — wipes guest pantry + flag, routes via AuthGate | ✅ |
| 5 | 7 unit tests in `test/screens/account/account_actions_test.dart`; full suite 448/448 passing, `flutter analyze` clean | ✅ |

**Commit:** `8fbc553` on `sprint/16.1-settings-redesign` (local only). **Not pushed** until on-device verification passes.

**Verification flow:** open the build → land on AppShell as guest → profile icon → AccountScreen → tap "Sign In" → email login → returns to AppShell signed-in. Then: AccountScreen → Sign Out → still on AppShell, still post-onboarding (no 15-screen replay). Then: AccountScreen → About → Restart Onboarding → walks the flow from screen 1.

## Competitor Analysis Cross-Reference (3 May 2026)

Source doc: `docs/strategy/2026-05-03-competitor-analysis.html` — deep-scan of 9 apps (Paprika · Mealime · SideChef · DishGen · Samsung Food · AnyList · Bring! · OurGroceries · Plan to Eat, plus Yummly postmortem after Whirlpool's December 2024 shutdown).

### Three moats Elio already owns — protect, don't erode

1. **AI generation grounded in actual pantry + perishable urgency.** Nobody else combines these. DishGen takes ingredient lists; Samsung Food has Vision AI but no expiry/dietary integration; Mealime + Paprika + AnyList don't generate at all.
2. **Receipt OCR + barcode + expiry-driven generation.** Samsung Food has barcode + Vision AI for ordering; no competitor does receipt OCR feeding recipe selection.
3. **Household dietary union math.** No competitor combines multiple humans' dietary restrictions and allergens into a single weekly plan.

### Five must-match gaps from analysis → sprint mapping

| # | Gap | Where it lives in this roadmap |
|---|-----|---------------------------|
| 1 | Real household sharing with email/link invite | **Sprint 16.7a investigation → 16.7b implementation** |
| 2 | In-app cooking timers + cook mode | **Sprint 16.6** |
| 3 | Browseable saved-recipe library + collections | **Sprint 16.7c** |
| 4 | Apple Watch + voice-assistant add-to-list | **Split:** Siri Shortcuts already in Sprint 19 (iOS pre-launch); Apple Watch + Alexa post-launch. Google Assistant blocked — Conversational Actions sunset June 2023, no viable Android voice path. |
| 5 | User-customisable aisle ordering | **Sprint 16.7c** |

### Deliberate omissions — features competitors have that Elio should NOT build

Capture here so they don't keep resurfacing in planning.

| Don't build | Why |
|---|---|
| Public recipe library / community feed | Yummly tried (now dead); DishGen does it badly (stolen recipes from Minimalist Baker). Moderation cost huge; dilutes the AI-from-your-pantry value. |
| Smart-fridge integration | Samsung Food's moat. Irrelevant for US-priority launch. |
| 18,000-recipe browseable corpus | SideChef's moat. Elio is generation-first; a library distracts from the differentiation. Personal saved-recipe library (Sprint 16.7c) is enough. |
| One-time pricing per platform (Paprika model) | Firestore + Gemini API recurring costs make it unsustainable for an AI app. |
| Step photos / videos for AI-generated recipes | Generated recipes can't have authentic cooking photos. Stock or AI-generated images would erode trust. Voice cooking is the "active cooking" answer. |
| Calorie/macro tracking with daily targets | MyFitnessPal territory. Different audience, harder to win. Per-recipe nutrition only. |
| Coupons / store flyers / price tracking | Flipp / Ibotta territory. Mood-killer for "what should I cook tonight." |

## Sprint 16.5 — Settings Menu On-Device Polish (Queued)

**Goal:** Walk every row of the new 4-section Settings tree on-device, catch the small things widget tests won't, ship the polish pass.

**Trigger:** Sprint 16.1 + 16.1.x both code-complete. Some items will be discovered during Rob's on-device run.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | On-device walk of every Settings row — copy, layout, tap targets, sub-screen pushes | Pending on-device pass |
| 2 | Manage Subscription — keep snackbar pointing to store, or deep-link to platform subscription page? | Not started |
| 3 | Notification Prefs sub-screen — confirm topics + toggles match what FCM actually subscribes to | Not started |
| 4 | Region toggle side-effects audit — US ↔ UK should propagate measurement units + currency across every screen | Not started |
| 5 | App Version row — show build tag (`build/sprint-X.Y`) alongside semver for easier QA reporting | Not started |
| 6 | Guest empty-state for AccountScreen — verify nothing flashes or errors when guest hits Settings (Firestore reads no-op for guests) | Not started |
| 7 | "Restart Onboarding" copy + dialog tone — confirm wording explains "Firestore data is kept, only local guest selections are cleared" clearly | Not started |
| 8 | New items discovered during the on-device walk | TBD |

**Estimate:** ~2 days once items crystallise on-device.

---

## Sprint 16.6 — Cook & Polish (Queued)

**Goal:** The "small but loud" pre-launch polish batch — cheap features competitors all have that reviewers complain about when missing.

| # | Task | Source | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Cooking timers + cook mode (screen-on)** on RecipeScreen. Paprika-style inline tappable times in method steps → `CookingTimerService` running timers; sticky timer bar across the recipe; `wakelock_plus` keeps the screen on while any timer is active; visible per-second tick + audible expiry beep. | Competitor analysis must-match gap #2 (Paprika + SideChef ship; reviews cite as stickiness driver) | ✅ Done (commits `26f7dcb` v1 → `57b6cbb` wakelock → `b7e1820` tick + audible) |
| 2 | ~~Dark mode~~ — explicitly dropped from Sprint 16.6 scope (12 May 2026, Rob). The cream / espresso / terracotta editorial palette is the brand; a dark variant would dilute it and the build cost is substantial relative to the launch-window value. Revisit only if 1-star reviews specifically cite the omission post-launch. | Competitor analysis flagged this as a must-match gap; product call says brand > parity | ❌ Dropped from scope |
| 3 | **Bulk-prep UI** — per-meal refresh ↺ icon on each `BulkPrepResultsScreen` card so a user can re-roll just one meal in the batch (mirrors the meal planner's per-slot regen). Wire-up to RecipeScreen + persistence shipped earlier (commits `299a013`, `9fd7b82`); this session added the refresh affordance via `GeminiService.generateBulkRecipeStream` with `previousMealTitles` set to all OTHER meals for meaningful dedup, Sprint 16.1 dietary refresh before regen, snackbar on error, keeps both old + new in history. | Existing TODO + competitor analysis | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) |
| 4 | **Perishable chip urgency-coloured backgrounds** on Pantry tab. `PantryChipUrgency.forItem` drives background + border + dot from expiry; matches the onboarding pantry-tile palette so Pantry tab and screens 11/12 speak the same colour language. | Standing follow-up (`project_perishable_chip_colors.md`) | ✅ Done (commit `4ba90a2`) |
| 5 | ~~Mood / style chip UI re-add on `RecipePreferencesScreen`~~ — confirmed stale (12 May 2026). The Time / Style / Mood chips have been live since Sprint 16's initial rebuild (`153e5a3`); Sprint 16.4 Bug 6 removed *Recipes-tab* filters, not prefs chips. Row was authored speculatively. | Sprint 16.4 deferred item | ❌ Closed as stale |
| 6 | Widget test asserting dietary filter actually greys a chip (plumbing tested, render path not). Added 2 render-path tests on `pantry_builder_sheet_usuals_test.dart`: vegan diet renders Milk chip with `TextDecoration.lineThrough` + dimmed mocha colour; empty dietary renders Milk with espresso + no decoration. Locks the conditional render branch in `_BuilderChip` so a future refactor that breaks the visual signal fails CI. | Sprint 15.9 pre-merge nit | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) — 2 new widget tests, 545/545 passing |
| 7 | `PantryMemoryEntry.isCustom` cleanup (drop or wire through) | Sprint 15.9 pre-merge nit | ✅ Done (commit `4ba90a2`) |
| 8 | **Pantry ↔ Shopping List "Restock" bridge** (Sprint 16.6.x). Pantry chip long-press exposes **Mark / Unmark running low** — sets `inventory.runningLow` AND adds/removes a `source: restock` shopping-list entry. Pantry chip shows a small terracotta **Low** badge; shopping row shows a **Restock** pill. Wires up `ShoppingService.addRestockItem` / `removeRestockItem`, which were defined but unreachable. | Test backlog item H4 unblocked — Rob asked "what is the restock button?" and the answer was "dead code" | ✅ Done (11 May 2026) — 6 new widget tests, 527/527 passing |
| 9 | **Small × on pantry chips for explicit delete.** Tiny × hit-target on every chip in the expanded tier rows. Tap → deletes immediately + shows "Removed X." snackbar with **Undo** (4-second window) that restores the chip via the same add path, preserving tier / expiry / runningLow. Distinct from long-press (tier / running-low / expiry picker — Remove still lives in-dialog for users already there). Implementation: `_TierItemChip` rebuilt as a side-by-side Row — RawGestureDetector for long-press on the chip body, separate GestureDetector + Tooltip + Semantics for the ×. Padding gives a ~30×26 hit area inside the existing chip footprint so chips don't grow tall. | Notion test list X-section, Rob 11 May | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) — 5 new widget tests, 532/532 passing |
| 10 | **Meal-type chip row on `RecipePreferencesScreen`.** New chip row above Time, below Bulk cook — three chips Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner, none selected by default. Single-select with mutual exclusivity (tapping Dinner deselects Breakfast) + tap-to-deselect (no "Any" sentinel — null is the no-preference state). Threads through `RecipePreferences.mealType` → `RecipeGenerationRequest.mealType` → a one-line hard constraint in `_buildPrompt` under `## HARD CONSTRAINTS`. **No example list deliberately** — positive examples ("eggs / toast / oatmeal") anchor output and narrow cultural breadth; Gemini-2.5-flash's training priors are stronger. Negative constraints can be added surgically later if device-test shows drift. | Rob 12 May 2026 | ✅ Done (12 May 2026) — 6 widget tests + 5 prompt unit tests, 543/543 passing |

**Estimate:** ~1 week.

---

## Sprint 16.7a — Household Sharing Investigation ✅ (11 May 2026)

**Goal:** Resolve the design complexity around real multi-user household sharing before committing to implementation. Output is a shovel-ready spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-sprint-16.7-household-sharing-design.md` plus a complexity estimate that gates Sprint 16.7b pre-/post-launch.

**Outcome:** Spec landed. Six foundational design decisions locked (full-share opt-in, owner-seeds-invitee-chooses migration, 6-digit code invites, owner's Pro extends to members, per-user dietary with cached household union, single-owner lifecycle). Independent `superpowers:code-reviewer` QA pass applied 5 critical fixes (dietary location, invitee-self-add rule, delete order, EntitlementService snippet, owner-profile filtering) and 5 worth-flagging adjustments. Final estimate: **~11 days** of focused implementation.

**Why this matters:** Competitor analysis must-match gap #1. AnyList's $14.99/yr household tier is the price anchor below Elio's $29.99/yr — defending requires real household sharing.

| # | Investigation question | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Firestore schema** — `households/{hid}` subtree with `owner`, `members[]`. Which sub-collections (shoppingItems, mealPlan, inventory, ratings, customItems, tierMemory) move from `users/{uid}/` to `households/{hid}/` vs stay per-UID? | Not started |
| 2 | **Invite flow** — Firebase Email Link / dynamic link / 6-digit code? Deep-link with accept-invite token. Edge cases: existing-account user vs new sign-up | Not started |
| 3 | **Security rules** — cross-UID read/write inside `households/{hid}/*` keyed on custom claims vs `get()` lookup. Performance trade-off | Not started |
| 4 | **Migration** — current household members are local profiles under one UID. Design for: (a) "head of household + dependents without phones" → keep profile-based; (b) "two adults each with own phone" → invite flow | Not started |
| 5 | **RevenueCat** — does household pricing need a new entitlement, or does an existing Pro subscriber's household grant Pro to invited members? Affects paywall copy | Not started |
| 6 | **Conflict resolution** — Firestore last-write-wins is fine; UI should attribute changes ("Kate added milk") | Not started |
| 7 | **UI scope** — invite tile on AccountScreen, member list in HouseholdScreen, owner-only actions, leave-household, guest-vs-member visibility | Not started |
| 8 | Spec doc + decision-gate write-up | Not started |

**Estimate:** 1–2 days.

**Decision gate at end of 16.7a:**
- Implementation ≤2 weeks → ship as **Sprint 16.7b pre-launch**
- Implementation >2 weeks → spec is shovel-ready; **punt 16.7b to v1.1 post-launch**

---

## Sprint 16.7b — Household Sharing Implementation (PUNTED to v1.1 post-launch)

**Decision (11 May 2026):** punted to **v1.1 post-launch**. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-sprint-16.7-household-sharing-design.md` is shovel-ready; implementation kicks off ~4-6 weeks after v1.0 launch as the headline feature of the first major update.

**Reasoning** (full version in spec §12):
- 11-day implementation estimate. Estimates run hot in this codebase (15.9 was 50% over, 16.1 trending similar). Realistic elapsed 15-18 days.
- Pre-launch already loaded with 16.6 + 16.8 + 17 + 18 + 19. Slotting 16.7b adds critical-path risk.
- Cloud Functions for `proActive` cheating prevention land in Sprint 17 — natural pairing if 16.7b ships post-launch alongside (rather than launching with a known security limitation in a marquee feature).
- Marketing benefit: dedicated "Elio now does household sharing" press moment vs. getting lost in launch noise.

**When work resumes:** writing-plans pass against the spec → Sprint 16.7b branch off whatever is `main` at the time.

---

## Sprint 16.7c — Browseable Library + Custom Aisles (Queued)

**Goal:** Decoupled from household sharing so it ships regardless of the 16.7a gate. Two competitor-analysis must-match gaps that don't depend on household infra.

| # | Task | Source | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Browseable saved-recipe library + collections** — UI repackaging of existing `users/{uid}/recipes/{id}` data (filter, sort, collections). Data exists; mostly merchandising | Competitor analysis must-match gap #3 | Not started |
| 2 | **User-customisable aisle ordering** — per-user `aisleOrder` on user doc. Lift Plan to Eat pattern; reviews tie it to long-term retention | Competitor analysis must-match gap #5 | Not started |

**Estimate:** 3–4 days.

---

## Sprint 16.8 — Email-Forward Order Import (Pre-Launch, in-flight)

**Goal:** Capture the growing online-grocery slice. User gets a unique elio inbox (`u_<token>@orders.eliochef.com`), forwards Instacart / Amazon Fresh / Tesco / Sainsbury's / Ocado / Kroger order confirmations, Elio parses line items into the pantry via the existing `InventoryWriter` (dedup-aware).

**Branch:** `feat/online-order-import` — design, plan, code complete (Postmark Inbound + 2 Cloud Functions + Gemini parser + review sheet UI). 31 tests green. Awaiting end-to-end real-email verification.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-25-online-order-import-design.md`
**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-online-order-import.md`

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Inbound email infra — Postmark Inbound chosen; MX on `orders.eliochef.com` (Hostinger DNS) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Per-user unique inbox `u_<13-char base32>@orders.eliochef.com` via `generateImportAddress` callable | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Cloud Function `postmarkInbound` — Basic Auth verify, SHA256 idempotency, write to `pending_imports` | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Email-to-pantry parser — Gemini structured output, retailer-agnostic | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Retailer regex table — Kroger / Fred Meyer / Tesco / Sainsbury's / Ocado / Walmart / Instacart / Amazon / Woolworths AU / Coles / Loblaws | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Settings UI — `OrderImportScreen` with Copy / Share, Pro-gated row in Preferences | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Pantry-tab dot badge + review sheet + apply flow via existing `InventoryWriter` | ✅ Done |
| 8 | End-to-end verification with a real grocery email (USER-GATE) — Kate's full A/B/C/D sweep on [the test sheet](https://www.notion.so/36d4718e358a8124bc6fd52f97b023a5) | In progress |
| 9 | **Postmark test-mode → approved (production)** — submit account approval to lift 100-email/month cap. Required before public launch. | Not started |
| 10 | Onboarding-friendly explainer — first-time discoverability | Infrastructure ✅ already shipped (generic `FeatureTipService` + bottom-sheet widget + catalogue + analytics via [PR #8](https://github.com/robchambo/elio-app/pull/8) → [PR #9 restore](https://github.com/robchambo/elio-app/pull/9), squash `10fa8a0`). Email-import tip entry deferred to v1.1 per spec §11. Adding later = one entry in `feature_tip_catalog.dart` + one `markFeatureUsed` call in the `OrderImportScreen` first-open path. |
| 11 | Domain rename audit — other `elio.app` references in `legal_links.dart`, paywall, onboarding strings still point at the placeholder domain | Not started |
| 12 | Spam / abuse guard — drop emails from unknown senders without an active forwarding rule (v1: bounce is implicit because unknown To: addresses return `{ignored: true}`; v1.1 might add explicit rate-limit + Postmark spam-filter tuning) | Deferred to v1.1 |

**Outstanding before launch:**
- Hostinger DNS: MX `orders.eliochef.com` → `inbound.postmarkapp.com`
- Postmark account approval (task #9 — currently 100-email cap in test mode)
- E2E verification with a real email (task #8)

**Why pre-launch (Rob's call, 11 May):** the moat extension over Samsung Food's smart-fridge integration — same job-to-be-done (track what you actually have at home) but reachable without locked-in hardware.

## Sprint 17 — Shared Launch Preparation

**Goal:** Everything that must be true before either store accepts a submission.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Performance audit (DevTools profiling, list optimisation, cold start time) | 3–4 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | **Firestore security rules audit** — rules are currently permissive (dev mode); must be locked down before public launch. Firebase console already flagging this. Also: data retention policy, input sanitisation | 2–3 | ⚠️ Partially done — rules + entitlement hardening landed on `sprint-17` branch (commits `8a17e8c`, `8c9e318`). Still to do: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`, emulator rule test suite, Cloud Functions backend so `weeklyGenerations` can be locked too, GCP budget caps |
| 3 | GDPR compliance (data export, account deletion, consent tracking) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 4 | Privacy policy + Terms of Service (in-app screens + hosted URLs — shared across both stores) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 5 | Remove temporary debug messages from home_screen.dart | 0.5 | Not started |
| 6 | Crashlytics → Slack/Discord webhook (real-time error alerts via Cloud Function) | 1–2 | Not started |
| 7 | Wire `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` through build.ps1 / `.env.local` + configure live Play Store + App Store SKUs with 7-day free trial | 2–3 | Partially done (build.ps1 wired, key not yet in .env.local) |
| 8 | Expand `ErrorService` coverage to GeminiService, FirestoreService, VoiceControlService, PurchaseService (currently only 4 call sites) | 1–2 | ✅ Done (Sprint 15.5 — ~15 call sites across 6 services) |
| 9 | **Email re-auth path for Delete Account.** `AccountScreen._reauthForDelete` currently only supports the Google provider — Email/password users get a snackbar pointing them at the support email. **Launch blocker** per Play Store + GDPR requirement for in-app account deletion across all auth methods. Wire `EmailAuthProvider.credential(...)` into the existing reauth callback, mirroring the Google branch. Added 11 May 2026 after discovering it during the Sprint 16.6 device-test pass. | 1–2 | Not started |
| 10 | **Forgot Password flow on-device verification.** `AuthService.sendPasswordReset` + `EmailLoginScreen` "Forgot password?" link are already wired. Verify end-to-end: enter email → tap link → email arrives → reset flow works → can sign in with the new password. Added 11 May 2026 — code in place since Sprint 15.x, never on-device confirmed. | 0.25 | Not started |
| 11 | **Onboarding hero imagery — confirm final art shipped.** Two onboarding image assets currently in the repo are interim, not Kate's finals: `assets/images/onboarding/welcome_hero.png` (screen 01 marketing hero) and `assets/images/onboarding/pantry_intro_hero.jpg` (screen 10 illustrated pantry shelf). Before submission, **diff both files against the final Kate-delivered art** and replace if different. Tell-tales the current ones are interim: (a) `welcome_hero.png` is the 19 May resized version of the original placeholder; (b) `pantry_intro_hero.jpg` has visible AI-generation typos (`GRAAIN RICE`, `FANIFER`). Also re-confirm: no other onboarding screen still renders a placeholder emoji or amber-tinted block where a real illustration should be. Added 19 May 2026. | 0.5 | Not started |
| 13 | **Cook Mode — keep screen on for the duration of hands-free.** `wakelock_plus` is currently held only while a recipe TIMER is active (Sprint 16.6 `_onTimerStateChange` logic). Cook Mode without a running timer hits the OS screen timeout (Rob's 2-minute setting caught this 21 May). 21may-a shipped an attempted fix (`_updateWakelock()` helper that OR-combined `_handsFreeMode || _timerService.hasActiveTimers`, wired into `_startHandsFree` / `_exitHandsFreeMode` / inline Done button) — that shipped a white-screen-on-Cook-Mode-entry regression that we couldn't root-cause inline, so it was reverted on 21may-b. Re-approach: try gating the platform call on `_handsFreeMode` via `initState` + dispose pair instead of the inline timer-callback path. Or use `WidgetsBindingObserver.didChangeAppLifecycleState` so we can defensively re-assert the wakelock on resume. Build 21may-a tag preserves the failed-attempt code for reference. Added 21 May 2026. | 1–2 | Reverted on 21may-b, needs fresh attempt |
| ~~12~~ | ~~Cook Mode voice — resume on identified failure mode.~~ | — | ✅ **Closed.** All four leads from this row shipped to `main` between 19–21 May (RECORD_AUDIO permission gate, stale `_isListening` flag fix, `error_busy` backoff, forked `speech_to_text` with 15s silence window, plus voice heartbeat + continuous-listening refactor — ~10 fix branches across ~12 builds). Notion test list bottom block records "Cook Mode voice arc closed. End-to-end working as of 21may-b." Row was added 20 May before the fixes landed and never flipped. |

**Estimate:** 16.75–28.75 hours

**Sprint 17 progress note (16 April 2026):** Firestore rules + entitlement hardening were committed on the `sprint-17` branch (currently unmerged). The old hard-coded dev-email allowlist and `proOverride` flag have been removed entirely; dev/tester Pro now comes from the Firestore doc `config/proTesters` (emails array). RevenueCat is the single source of truth for paying users. Branch needs `flutter analyze` + a PR to `main`.

## Sprint 18 — Android Track

**Goal:** Play Store submission-ready. Runs in parallel with Sprint 19 iOS work.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Full regression test — Android physical device | 3–4 | Not started |
| 2 | Play Store assets (screenshots, feature graphic, store listing copy) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 3 | Submit to Google Play Console (internal testing track) | 1–2 | Not started |
| 4 | Closed beta feedback loop (pro-tester Firestore list) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 5 | Production staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%) | 1 | Not started |
| 6 | Yummly-migration landing page ("Coming from Yummly? We import your saved recipes") — capture residual displaced audience | 1 | Not started |

**Estimate:** 10–14 hours

---

## Sprint 19 — iOS Track

**Goal:** App Store submission-ready in parallel with Android. Target a coordinated launch window — Android may go live a few days earlier if Apple review is slower.

| # | Task | Est. Hours | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | iOS build configuration and signing (Xcode, provisioning profiles, bundle ID) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 2 | Apple Sign-In integration (required by App Store when Google Sign-In is present) | 3–4 | Not started |
| 3 | iOS-specific UI adjustments (safe areas, haptics, keyboard behaviour) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 4 | Replace `com.elio/audio` platform channel with iOS equivalent (AVAudioSession) OR gate voice-beep suppression to Android only | 1–2 | Not started |
| 5 | **Siri Shortcuts** — donate `NSUserActivity` for "Generate a recipe", "Open my shopping list", "What's in my pantry", "Start cooking last recipe", and "Add to my shopping list" (voice-assistant add-to-list from competitor analysis). Must be done before launch so iOS users get voice entry points on day one. | 3–4 | Not started |
| 6 | iOS permissions plist (NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, NSCameraUsageDescription, NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription) | 0.5 | Not started |
| 7 | Full regression test — iOS physical device | 3–4 | Not started |
| 8 | App Store assets (iOS screenshots at required sizes, App Store listing) | 2–3 | Not started |
| 9 | Submit to TestFlight | 1–2 | Not started |
| 10 | App Store review submission | 1 | Not started |

**Estimate:** 18.5–26.5 hours

## Post-Launch Backlog (Prioritised)

### v1.1 — from competitor analysis (early post-launch)

| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P1** | **Sprint 16.7b — Real Household Sharing** (headline v1.1 feature) | Multi-UID household with full data sharing (inventory, shopping, meal plan), 6-digit code invites, owner's Pro extends to up to 6 members. Competitor-analysis must-match gap #1. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-sprint-16.7-household-sharing-design.md`. **~11 days implementation** + Sprint 17 Cloud Function dependencies (RC webhook, monthly sweep, cascade-delete sweep — 2.5-3 days incremental). |
| P1 | **Apple Watch app** | Read-only shopping list with check-off. Three of four shopping-list competitors have it; AnyList + OurGroceries reviewers cite as top-3 feature. |
| 🚫 Blocked | **Google Assistant add-to-list (Android)** | Originally targeted as Android counterpart to Siri Shortcuts. **Blocked** — Google sunset Conversational Actions in June 2023 with no replacement third-party write API for the Assistant shopping list; Gemini-the-Assistant has no public extension submission process either (partner integrations only). Confirmed unworkable 21 May 2026 via the [shopping-list-sync research](https://www.notion.so/3654718e358a800ba458fffcec60d67e). Re-evaluate only if Google ships a developer platform for the next-gen Assistant. |
| P1 | **Free-tier shopping list** (single list, no household, no recipe-link) | Widens conversion funnel. OurGroceries gives full list free; Elio's all-or-nothing gating may cap free-to-paid. |
| P2 | **Wider recipe-import site coverage** | Top-50 cooking domains with validated parsers as fallback to Vision OCR. AnyList + Plan to Eat publish supported-domain lists. |
| P2 | **Alexa skill** | Add via Alexa Skills Kit List Management API (`POST /v2/householdlists/.../items`) with a Lambda/HTTPS webhook writing to Firestore. Confirmed P2 post-launch on 21 May 2026 after the broader [shopping-list-sync research](https://www.notion.so/3654718e358a800ba458fffcec60d67e) closed off all Android voice paths — Alexa is the only non-iOS smart-speaker integration that's still possible. Expected adoption: niche but real for Echo households. **Dev prerequisite:** pick up a used Echo Dot (~$20) before starting. Cert iteration is ~1 week per cycle and Amazon's reviewers test on real devices, so simulator-only dev means flying blind on device-only bugs. |
| P2 | **Feature-tip system polish + catalogue expansion** | The `FeatureTipService` shipped Sprint 16.8 (commit `10fa8a0`) is currently Style A bottom-sheets with two pilot tips (Recipe Import, Meal Plan → Shopping). Post-launch polish pass: (a) **Style B spotlight coach-marks** (`showcaseview` dep, `GlobalKey`-based targeting) for the gesture features where spatial highlighting matters — Cook Mode timer-number taps, long-press ingredient chip → Substitute/Regen, long-press pantry chip → Running Low. (b) **Catalogue expansion** — add tips for Bulk Prep toggle, Makeable-Now filter, Side Dish suggestion, bookmark-from-history, barcode/receipt scanner edit affordances (full ~11-feature backlog from the Sprint 16.8 discoverability survey). (c) **Backfill `logFeatureUsed(...)` events** across every candidate feature so the v1.1 catalogue expansion has real analytics to target by ("which features actually get missed"). (d) **Settings → "Show me tips again"** debug/reset toggle that wipes `seenTips` (both local SharedPrefs `seen_tip_*` keys + the Firestore field), so testers + users who want to re-explore can. Trivial — one button + a `FeatureTipService.resetAllSeen()` method. Plan/test procedure already exists at https://www.notion.so/36c4718e358a818fb69cf414a3d143d2 — extend it for the new entries. |

### v1.2 — competitor analysis (data-driven post-launch)

| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P1** | **Cloud-sync saved recipes** | Saved recipes currently live in SharedPreferences only (`HistoryService`, key `elio_recipe_history`) — device-local, no Firestore mirror. Sign in on a fresh device and your history is gone; clear-data wipes it; reinstall wipes it. Mirror to `users/{uid}/savedRecipes/{savedAt}` (or include in household sharing in 16.7b). Likely also explains some "where did my recipes go?" feedback during on-device testing. |
| P2 | **Multiple lists** (groceries, Costco, hardware) | AnyList + Bring! + OurGroceries + Plan to Eat all support. Generalize shopping-list model. After household sharing lands. |
| P2 | **Recurring lists / templates** | "Weekly staples" template that clones to active list. AnyList + OurGroceries have. |
| P2 | **Family pricing tier** ($X/yr household, AnyList-style at $14.99/yr) | After Sprint 16.7 household sharing proves out. Match AnyList structure. |
| P2 | **Per-store aisle layouts** ("my Trader Joe's, my Whole Foods") | After basic custom aisle ordering (16.7c) proves out. Plan to Eat's stickiness driver. |
| P3 | **Geofence "at the store" reminders** | Bring!-style. Niche-loved; battery + permission friction. |

### Carry-over from existing backlog

| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| P1 | Accurate cost estimation | Supermarket API integration for real pricing |
| P1 | Regional language localisation | courgette/zucchini, coriander/cilantro, etc. |
| P2 | Grocery affiliate integration | Shopping list → delivery service |
| P2 | Social sharing | Recipe card as shareable image |
| P2 | Recipe ratings & feedback loop | Like/dislike influences future generation (internal adaptive learning already shipped — this is the user-visible surface) |
| P3 | Multilingual support | Full app translation |
| P3 | Tablet/web layout optimisation | Responsive layouts for larger screens |
| P3 | Offline mode | Cache recent recipes, local-first pantry for all users |

### Small loose ends from memory + earlier sprints

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Onboarding screens 06–15 still using `ElioHeroHeading` wrapper | Migrate to `ElioPageTitle` directly |
| Legacy `ElioTextStyles` aliases cleanup + delete `ElioHeroHeading` wrapper | Sweep callers, delete aliases |
| Per-pantry-item dietary metadata pass | ~100+ items in `PantryCategories.all` need per-item dietary tags (content authoring, Kate-voice decision on hide vs grey) |
| Screen 11/12 search bar | Deferred from Sprint 16.2; reassess after on-device feedback |
| Screen 10 hero illustration | Kate art (currently placeholder) |
| Coordinator-owned single progress bar | Replace per-screen progress bars (minor visual refactor) |
| Sprint 18 original (App Check + server-side Gemini migration) | Deferred — original sprint number reused for Android track |
| Widen `TimeParser` regex to cover ranges + natural language | Sprint 16.6 v1 deliberately excluded ranges ("5–10 minutes"), decimals ("1.5 hours"), and natural-language ("about an hour", "half an hour"). Cook Mode on-device testing surfaced a real recipe with a duration that wasn't matched. Cheapest wins: ranges (default to lower bound) and "about/around N". |
| Restore "Generate Recipe with These" auto-generation after scan | 19 May 2026 (`fix/scan-success-naked-pantry-push`): both ScanSuccessScreen CTAs used to push naked PantryScreen / HomeScreen via MaterialPageRoute, bypassing AppShell's Scaffold and rendering on a black background. Fixed by popping to root, but the lost feature is HomeScreen receiving `scannedItems` for auto-generation. Restore via an AppShell hook (e.g. `initialPendingScannedItems` constructor param, or a singleton `AppShellController` that lets external screens switch tabs + push state). Sprint 17. |

## Known Issues

- `google-services.json` not in git — must be added manually after fresh clone
- Dev flavor broken — always use `--flavor prod`
- iOS URL scheme placeholder needs filling before any iOS build
- APK size 72.9 MB (mobile_scanner ML Kit) — may need app bundles for Play Store
- `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` wired in build.ps1 but actual key not yet in `.env.local` (need RC project setup)
